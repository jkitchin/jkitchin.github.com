#+title: Kitchingroup blog

[2025-01-28 Tue] This is getting really out of date

1. You cannot run the blogofile software except in the venv which is pinned at python 3.8

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
source .venv/bin/activate
#+END_SRC

1. I had to modify some code at [[./../python/blogofile/]] and  [[./../python/blogofile_blog/]]
 to get it to run

2. it was tricky to install.

The _deploy folder is actually the master branch of this repo that hosts the html.

the main folder is the source branch.

As soon as it makes sense, I need to archive this and start a new blog.

it is too complicated.
