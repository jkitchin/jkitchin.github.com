=odelay= was recently updated to support multiple odes with events. Here is an example. We want the solutions to:

\begin{align}
\frac{dy_1}{dx} = y_2 \\
\frac{dy_2}{dx} = -y_1
\end{align}

with initial conditions $y_1(0) = 2$ and $y_2(0) = 1$. We want to stop the integration when $y_2 = -1$ and find out when $dy_1/dx=0$ and at a maximum.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from pycse import odelay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def ode(Y,x):
    y1, y2 = Y
    dy1dx = y2
    dy2dx = -y1
    return [dy1dx, dy2dx]

def event1(Y, x):
    y1, y2 = Y
    value = y2 - (-1.0)
    isterminal = True
    direction  = 0
    return value, isterminal, direction

def event2(Y, x):
    dy1dx, dy2dx = ode(Y,x)
    value = dy1dx - 0.0
    isterminal = False
    direction = -1  # derivative is decreasing towards a maximum
    return value, isterminal, direction

Y0 = [2.0, 1.0]
xspan = np.linspace(0, 5)
X, Y, XE, YE, IE = odelay(ode, Y0, xspan, events=[event1, event2])

plt.plot(X, Y)
for ie,xe,ye in zip(IE, XE, YE):
    if ie == 1: #this is the second event
        y1,y2 = ye
        plt.plot(xe, y1, 'ro') 
        
plt.legend(['$y_1$', '$y_2$'], loc='best')
