#+TITLE: The org-ref Show
#+AUTHOR: John Kitchin
* Welcome to org-ref                                                  :slide:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp-slide
(org-show-animate '("org-ref" "Citations," "references," "and bibtex utilities in org-mode" "John Kitchin" "June 24, 2014"))
#+END_SRC

* Setup								      :slide:
Get it at https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/org-ref.org
Get dash 2.6.0 https://github.com/magnars/dash.el

Load org-ref with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-load-file "org-ref.org")
#+END_SRC

Set these variables in your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib"))

;; see org-ref for use of these variables
(setq org-ref-bibliography-notes "~/Dropbox/bibliography/notes.org"
      org-ref-default-bibliography '("~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib")
      org-ref-pdf-directory "~/Dropbox/bibliography/bibtex-pdfs/")
#+END_SRC

* Features							      :slide:

- Functional links for citations, references, bibliographies

- export bibliographies in LaTeX, HTML, plain text

- utility functions for dealing with bibtex files and citations in org-files

* Bibliography links						      :slide:

For bibtex, use

[[bibliography:~/Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib]]

links to indicate the bibliography. Put this at the end where you want your bibliography to show up.

You can also set the
bibliographystyle:unsrt

This link only exports, no click action defined.

For biblatex, use
addbibresource:bib.bib

* Citations
** Simple usage of citations					      :slide:

Here is a default citation cite:freeman-2014-activ.
Insert these with "C-c ]". cite:mehta-2014-ident-poten
cite:hallenbeck-2013-effec-o2

cite:thompson-2014-co2-react

To change that, use

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-ref-insert-cite-key "C-c )")
#+END_SRC

You can quickly get other types like this: M-x reftex-citation
autocite:thompson-2014-co2-react

autocite:calle-vallejo-2013-number
Change the default citation like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-ref-default-citation-link "autocite")
#+END_SRC

Click on the link and checkout the menu!

** Completion							      :slide:

Type C-c C-l start typing the citation type, and let completion do the work for you.

[[cite:mehta-2014-ident-poten]]

[[citep*:mehta-2014-ident-poten]]
** Multiple citations						      :slide:

You can select multiple references in the reftex selection buffer.

You can click on each citation in the link.

If you put the cursor on a link, and add more citations, they get added to the end.

cite:mehta-2014-ident-poten,thompson-2014-co2-react,hallenbeck-2013-effec-o2,miller-2013-simul-temper,xu-2013-relat,thompson-2014-co2-react
** Rearrange citations						      :slide:

Use Shift-arrow keys to move citations left and right, e.g. to put them in chronological order, or some other desired order.

cite:mao-2013-inter,calle-vallejo-2013-number,miller-2013-simul-temper,hallenbeck-2013-effec-o2,thompson-2014-co2-react,mehta-2014-ident-poten

You may prefer to call M-x org-ref-sort-citation-link on the link. This sorts by year.

** Find bad cite links						      :slide:

cite:miller-2013-simul-temper

elisp:org-ref-find-bad-citations

** Get the bibtex entries you cited				      :slide:

Need to send a self-contained document to someone? No problem, just get the bibtex entries and save them in the file.

* References to things in a file

** The label link						      :slide:

Clicking on a label link tells you in the minibuffer how many instances of that label exist. It should only be one. Many forms of label are looked for, including latex forms, org-mode forms, and tblname.

#+caption: A little table. label:tab-little
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 5 |


You may prefer to use tblnames, these serve as labels too.

#+tblname: tab-little-2
#+caption: A another little table.
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 5 |
| 6 | 5 |

** Labeling a figure						      :slide:

#+caption: A little figure. label:fig-little
[[./tst.png]]

You might prefer org-labels
#+caption: A little figure.
#+label: fig-little-2
[[./tst.png]]

** The ref link							      :slide:

You make a reference to a label with ref:tab-little.  Or see Figure ref:fig-little.

ref:fig-little-2

Table ref:tab-little-2

This works with completion too. [[ref:eq-simple]]
** The eqref link						      :slide:

Equation environments get numbered in LaTeX, so you can refer to them by number.

\begin{equation}
2 + 2 = 4 \label{eq-simple}
\end{equation}

In Equation [[eqref:eq-simple]] we see a simple example. eqref does not have completion. If you click on the link, it goes to the label in the equation.

** Obscure ref links \label{sec-obscure}			      :slide:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: my-obscure-section
   :END:

You can make a link to the section named nameref:sec-obscure. You must put the raw label in the headline for this.

You can make a reference to page pageref:sec-obscure. That only makes sense for LaTeX export.


You can also use the regular org link: [[#my-obscure-section]]
* List of tables and figures					      :slide:

Clickable links for list-of-tables:lot, and list-of-figures:lof. They generate a clickable list of those things for you.

* Utilities							      :slide:
org-ref defines some utilities for bibtex entries.

My favorite is: org-ref-clean-bibtex-entry

This function sanitizes bibtex entries to make sure they have
1. standard key format
2. standard field order and case
3. no non-ascii characters
4. No naked & characters
5. no empty year
6. puts eid in pages if they are empty
7. removes https://doi.org from the doi if it is there.
8. indents the entry nicely.

It is easiest to see what I mean. Here is a typical bibtex entry from an ACS journal.

Run M-x org-ref-clean-bibtex-entry on this entry
