Titania can be grown as an epitaxial thin film on many perovskites. The structure of the film depends on the perovskite, as well as the orientation of the surface the film grows on. In this work, we show which factors determine this, including epitaxial strain, and interface energies. In general no single factor determines all the behavior, but when considered collectively, our computational analysis correctly predicts which thin film polymorph is observed experimentally most of the time.

DFT calculations are not exact, and the uncertainties in a calculation can impact conclusions you draw from the results. In this work, we quantify the uncertainty in the adsorption energies on Pt(111) and (100) of oxygenated intermediates  relevant to the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism. We then propagate these uncertainties to the volcano plot of activity that results from them, and show how this approach helps inform us about the reliability of the predicted trends.

We have a new paper out on using org-mode in publishing. The idea is to use org-mode to automate data embedding in publications. For example, in org-mode tables can serve as data sources. We show how you can automatically embed the tables as csv files in PDF or HTML when the org-file is exported. Similarly, all the code blocks are embedded as extractable files at export time. This increases the reusability of the data and code in papers.

                  need for an authoring workflow that easily integrates data and

                  published in reusable form. Automated embedding of data and
                  code into published output will enable superior communication
                  and data archiving. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of
                  concept for a workflow, org-mode, which successfully provides
                  this authoring capability and workflow integration. We
                  illustrate this concept in a series of examples for potential
                  uses of this workflow. First, we use data on citation counts
                  to compute the h-index of an author, and show two code
                  examples for calculating the h-index. The source for each
                  example is automatically embedded in the PDF during the export
                  of the document. We demonstrate how data can be embedded in
                  image files, which themselves are embedded in the document.
                  Finally, metadata about the embedded files can be
                  automatically included in the exported PDF, and accessed by
                  computer programs. In our customized export, we embedded
                  metadata about the attached files in the PDF in an Info field.
                  A computer program could parse this output to get a list of
                  embedded files and carry out analyses on them. Authoring tools
                  such as Emacs + org-mode can greatly facilitate the
                  integration of data and code into technical writing. These

This paper uses a kernel regression method trained on a large set of DFT calculations from the Materials Project to design new materials. A notable feature of this approach is it opens the door to inverse design, since the mathematical form of the regression is accessible. In the paper we predict electronic properties and elastic constants for a large number of metal oxides. Congratulations Bruno for this work!

It is well known that DFT calculations are expensive, which limits the size of the calculations that can be performed, the number of them that can be performed, and their use in simulation methods such as molecular dynamics.  Molecular potentials are more suitable for these types of simulations, but they must be parameterized by some means. In this paper, we use a database of DFT calculations to train ReaxFF and a neural network potential. We compare and contrast these potentials with respect to their accuracy, trainability, and speed of calculation with application to properties of Au bulk, cluster and surface properties. There are clear tradeoffs with these two approaches, but both have advantages for different purposes. Congratulations Jake and Mitch! See the paper here: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qua.25115.

Some time ago we published this paper on the coverage dependence of the adsorption energies of atomic adsorbates on different sites cite:xu-2014-probin-cover. One of the concerns in that work was whether van der Waal forces were significant for some adsorbates. Well, now we have addressed that concern in a new paper in Surface Science! In this new work we use the BEEF functional to simultaneously access the impact of van der Waal forces on the adsorption energy trends, as well as do some error analysis on the significance of the coverage dependence. I won't ruin the surprise too much; the good news is that yes van der Waals do influence adsorption of atomic adsorbates on metal surfaces, but the trends are mostly the same! See the paper for more details. Congratulations Hari!

We have a new publication in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. on the reactivity of different oxide polymorphs. In this work we examine the reactivity of some common BO_{2} oxide polymorphs for Ru, Rh, Pt and Ir oxides. These are all normally rutile formers, but it may be possible to synthesize them in other polymorphs as epitaxial films, or under pressure. We examined how the reactivity of the polymorphs would differ from that of the most stable phase, and the impact of those changes on the oxygen evolution reaction. We predict that the reactivity may be improved in some cases. Congratulations Zhongnan!

Predicting the relative stability of oxide polymorphs is critical to predicting which structures are likely to be experimentally observed. The energetics of TiO_{2} polymorphs are particularly challenging because the energies of the different polymorphs are relatively close together. Consequently, one predicts different relative stabilities using different exchange correlation functionals with DFT. In this paper, we show that DFT+U is able to give experimentally consistent relative orderings for the GGA functionals, and that linear response U can be used to predict a reasonable value of U.  Hybrid functionals can also do this for some ranges of the exact exchange fraction, but there is not yet a method to calculate from first-principles the amount of exact exchange required to achieve that. Notably, the U-values are pseudopotential and functional dependent.

This paper is open-access.

In this perspective we show an example of data sharing practices we have developed. We use the supporting information file from cite:boes-2015-estim-bulk to show how one can extract the data from our paper and reuse it for new purposes. We illustrate this for both computational and experimental data. We use org-mode for doing this, but we also show that data in the supporting information can be extracted using Python, and independently of Emacs, so that org-mode is not critical for people who do not use it.

In this perspective we illustrate how we use org-mode to prepare manuscripts and supporting information files that are rich in data, and that make it easy to share the code we use for our analysis. We use the supporting information file from cite:boes-2015-core-cu to show examples of how to extract the data, and reuse it in new analyses. This approach works for both computational and experimental data.

In this paper we show that the electrolyte can  modify the reactivity of nickel hydroxide based electrodes for electrochemical water oxidation. There are two effects that are important: 1) Fe-impurities, and 2) the identify of the electrolyte cation. Fe-impurities are known to promote water oxidation. We found that a LiOH electrolyte can /suppress/ the oxygen evolution reaction, which is also known from the battery literature. KOH and CsOH are the best electrolytes for the OER on nickel hydroxide based electrodes.

In this collaborative paper we map out the electronic structure of a Cu-Pd alloy across composition space, and then correlate that electronic structure with the reactivity of the alloy. We experimentally measure the average energy of the filled valence band, and show it is similar to the calculated d-band center. We then show how those measured electronic structure properties correlate with the H_{2}\D_{2} exchange kinetics. The combination of experiments on composition spread alloy films (CSAF) and theory provides an integrated understanding of alloy reactivity in this system.

This landmark paper cite:norskov-2004-origin recently hit 1000+ citations! In this paper we lay out a framework using density functional theory to calculate the stabilities of intermediates in electrochemical processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. This was a very early use of electrochemical atomistic thermodynamics in which the electric potential and pH were both accounted for in the electrochemical reaction energies. We showed how the volcano plots frequently observed arise from trends in adsorption energies that are easily calculated. This paper also shows one of the earliest scaling relations between O and OH adsorption energies!

This paper came out shortly after I spent three months at DTU with Jens Nørskov when I was a PhD student. I still remember talking to him about the work that led to this paper one day at their regular afternoon department tea time. He suggested some DFT calculations that I knew how to do, and I went back to the office and worked on them the rest of the night. He wrote this amazing paper afterwards that has been cited over and over. Congratulations Jens! I am proud to have had a part in it.

*Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution with an Immobilized TAML Activator*

Ethan L. Demeter, Shayna L. Hilburg, Newell R. Washburn, Terrence J. Collins, and John R. Kitchin

Iron complexes of tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands are important members of the suite of oxidation catalysts known as TAML activators. TAML activators are known to be fast homogeneous water oxidation (WO) catalysts, producing oxygen in the presence of chemical oxidants, e.g., ceric ammonium nitrate. These homogeneous systems exhibited low turnover numbers (TONs). Here we demonstrate immobilization on glassy carbon and carbon paper in an ink composed of the prototype TAML activator, carbon black, and Nafion and the subsequent use of this composition in heterogeneous electrocatalytic WO. The immobilized TAML system is shown to readily produce O2 with much higher TONs than the homogeneous predecessors.

*Identifying Potential BO2 Oxide Polymorphs for Epitaxial Growth Candidates*,
by Prateek Mehta, Paul A. Salvador, and John R. Kitchin
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149

Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2 dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.

As with other recent papers, the supporting information file contains embedded data files that enable the reproduction of the data and figures in the paper.

Simulating Temperature Programmed Desorption of Oxygen on Pt(111) Using DFT Derived Coverage Dependent Desorption Barriers

Abstract

The dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on Pt(111) is known to be coverage dependent. Simple Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments that assumes a coverage independent desorption barrier can lead to errors in estimated properties such as desorption barriers and adsorption energies. A simple correction is to assume a linear coverage dependence of the desorption barrier, but there is usually no formal justification given for that functional form. More advanced TPD analysis methods that are suitable for determining coverage dependent adsorption parameters are limited by their need for large amounts of high quality, low noise data. We present a method to estimate the functional form of the coverage dependent desorption barrier from density functional theory calculations for use in analysis of TPD spectra. Density functional theory was employed to calculate the coverage dependence of the adsorption energy. Simulated TPD spectra were then produced by empirically scaling the DFT based adsorption energies utilizing the Bronstead-Evans-Polyani relationship between adsorption energies and desorption barriers. The resulting simulated spectra show better agreement with the experimental spectra than spectra predicted using barriers that are either coverage-independent or simply linearly dependent on coverage. The empirically derived scaling of the desorption barriers for Pt(111) is shown to be useful in predicting the low coverage desorption barriers for oxygen desorption from other metal surfaces, which showed reasonable agreement with the reported experimental values for those other metals.

The [[http://link.springer.com/content/esm/art:10.1007/s11244-013-0166-3/file/MediaObjects/11244_2013_166_MOESM1_ESM.pdf][supporting information]] file is especially interesting because it has nearly all of the data files used in the paper embedded in it!

Relating the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of the 3d Transition Metal Monoxide Surfaces

    Zhongnan Xu, and  John R. Kitchin

We performed a series of density functional theory calculations of dissociative oxygen adsorption on fcc metals and their corresponding rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the relationship between the oxide electronic structure and its corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of the adsorption energy on the metal and a change in adsorption energy caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were able to identify the key features of the electronic structure that explains the trends in adsorption energies on 3d transition metal monoxide surfaces.

Our manuscript titled "Comparisons of Amine Solvents for Post-combustion CO$_2$ Capture: A Multi-objective Analysis Approach" by Anita Lee, John Eslick, David Miller, and John Kitchin was just accepted in International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control. In this paper we used a genetic algorithm to find pareto-optimal operating conditions of amine solvent CO2 capture systems that minimize capital cost and parasitic power cost. We compared MEA, DEA and AMP, and found that there are operating conditions where both solvents could be better than MEA.
