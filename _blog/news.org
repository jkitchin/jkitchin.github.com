In this paper we continue our exploration of using high-dimensional neural networks (NN) to model metal surface properties. Our first work started with modeling Au in a variety of structures using ReaxFF and a NN cite:boes-2016-neural-networ. We then modeled atomic oxygen adsorbates on a Pd (111) surface cite:boes-2017-neural-networ, and segregation of an Au-Pd alloy surface cite:boes-2017-model-segreg. Our goal throughout this work has been to systematically build up complexity in the systems we are modeling, and to explore the limitations of these potentials for modeling surfaces. This current work happened in parallel with those works, and focused on modeling Pd adatom diffusion on Pd(111) surfaces. We show another example of how to train a neural network, and then to use it model the temperature dependent diffusion of adatoms on a metal surface using molecular dynamics and Arrhenius analysis.

Single atom alloys are alloys in the extreme dilute limit, where single atoms of a reactive metal are surrounded by comparatively unreactive metals. This makes the single reactive atoms like single atom sites where reactions can occur. These sites are interesting because they are metallic, but their electronic structure is different than the atoms in more concentrated alloys. This means there is the opportunity for different, perhaps better catalytic performance for the single atom alloys. In this paper, we studied the electronic structure and some representative reaction pathways on a series of single atom alloy surfaces.

                  correlated with the d-band center, or the average reactivity

This paper is our latest work using neural networks in molecular simulation. In this work, we build a Behler-Parinello neural network potential of bulk zirconia. The potential can describe several polymorphs of zirconia, as well as oxygen vacancy defect formation energies and diffusion barriers. We show that we can use the potential to model oxygen vacancy diffusion using molecular dynamics at different temperatures, and to use that data to estimate the effective diffusion activation energy. This is further evidence of the general utility of the neural network-based potential for molecular simulations with DFT accuracy.

DFT calculations are extensively used to predict the chemical properties of metal alloy surfaces, but they are expensive which limits the number of calculations that can be practically be calculated. In this paper, we explore a perturbation approach known as alchemy to take previously calculated results and extend them to new compositions. We use oxygen reduction as a prototype reaction, and show that alchemy is often much faster than DFT, with an accuracy within 0.1 eV of the DFT. There are cases where the accuracy is not as good suggesting that further improvements to the perturbation model could be beneficial. Overall, alchemy appears to be a useful tool in high-throughput screening research.

Usually, metal oxides grow in a single, most stable crystal structure at a particular set of conditions. For example, TiO_{2} grows in the rutile structure for a large range of pressure and temperature conditions, but under some conditions it can also grow in the anatase structure. In this paper we show that epitaxial stabilization can be used to influence which crystal structures are observed for the growth of tin oxide. Tin oxide is normally only observed in the rutile structure. We grew tin oxide as an epitaxial film on a poly-crystalline substrate of CoNb_{2}O_{6} which has an \alpha-PbO_{2} crystal structure. We found that both rutile and \alpha-PbO_{2} structures could be found in the film, and that the structure correlated with the orientation of the underlying grains. In other words, the orientation of a substrate can influence the structure of an epitaxial film, enabling one to grow films in crystal structures that may be metastable, and unobtainable in bulk samples.

Alloys can have rich, complex phase behavior. Cu-Pd alloys for example show an unusual behavior where a BCC lattice forms for some compositions, even though the alloy is made from two metals that are exclusively FCC in structure! Being able to model and predict this kind of behavior is a major challenge. In this work, we use cluster expansions to model the configurational degrees of freedom in the FCC and BCC lattices and show qualitatively that we can predict the region where the B2 phase (the BCC one) forms. The agreement with experiment is not quantitative though, and we show that part this disagreement is due to the lack of vibrational entropy in the cluster expansion. When we include vibrational entropy, the qualitative agreement improves.

Molecules interact with each other when they adsorb on surfaces and these interactions are coverage dependent. Modeling these interactions is a challenge though, because there are many configurations of adsorbates on the surface, and the surface changes due to the interactions. To mitigate these challenges, one often simplifies the model, e.g. by using a cluster expansion or lattice gas Hamiltonian. These approaches have their own limitations though, and are not that useful for modeling dynamic processes like diffusion. Using molecular potentials enables the dynamic simulations, but not at the same level of accuracy as density functional theory. In this work we use density functional theory to train a neural network, and then use the neural network to model coverage-dependent adsorption isotherms and the dynamics of oxygen diffusion on a Pd(111) surface. We show the neural network can capture the onset of surface oxidation, and that the simulation results have comparable accuracy to the DFT calculations it was trained from.

The surface composition of an alloy is rarely the same as the bulk composition due to segregation, and it changes with changing reaction conditions. Segregation is a ubiquitous issue in alloy catalysis, and makes modeling alloy surfaces a challenge, because we need to know the surface composition to model them! In this work, we take a first step in using density functional theory to build a neural network potential that we can use with Monte Carlo simulations to predict the temperature dependent surface composition of an Au-Pd bulk alloy in a vacuum. This approach yielded quantitative predictions in good agreement with experimental measurements over the entire bulk composition range.

Titania can be grown as an epitaxial thin film on many perovskites. The structure of the film depends on the perovskite, as well as the orientation of the surface the film grows on. In this work, we show which factors determine this, including epitaxial strain, and interface energies. In general no single factor determines all the behavior, but when considered collectively, our computational analysis correctly predicts which thin film polymorph is observed experimentally most of the time.

DFT calculations are not exact, and the uncertainties in a calculation can impact conclusions you draw from the results. In this work, we quantify the uncertainty in the adsorption energies on Pt(111) and (100) of oxygenated intermediates  relevant to the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism. We then propagate these uncertainties to the volcano plot of activity that results from them, and show how this approach helps inform us about the reliability of the predicted trends.

We have a new paper out on using org-mode in publishing. The idea is to use org-mode to automate data embedding in publications. For example, in org-mode tables can serve as data sources. We show how you can automatically embed the tables as csv files in PDF or HTML when the org-file is exported. Similarly, all the code blocks are embedded as extractable files at export time. This increases the reusability of the data and code in papers.

                  need for an authoring workflow that easily integrates data and

                  and data archiving. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of
                  concept for a workflow, org-mode, which successfully provides
                  this authoring capability and workflow integration. We
                  illustrate this concept in a series of examples for potential
                  uses of this workflow. First, we use data on citation counts
                  to compute the h-index of an author, and show two code
                  examples for calculating the h-index. The source for each
                  example is automatically embedded in the PDF during the export
                  of the document. We demonstrate how data can be embedded in
                  image files, which themselves are embedded in the document.
                  Finally, metadata about the embedded files can be
                  automatically included in the exported PDF, and accessed by
                  computer programs. In our customized export, we embedded
                  metadata about the attached files in the PDF in an Info field.
                  A computer program could parse this output to get a list of

                  such as Emacs + org-mode can greatly facilitate the

This paper uses a kernel regression method trained on a large set of DFT calculations from the Materials Project to design new materials. A notable feature of this approach is it opens the door to inverse design, since the mathematical form of the regression is accessible.

It is well known that DFT calculations are expensive, which limits the size of the calculations that can be performed, the number of them that can be performed, and their use in simulation methods such as molecular dynamics.  Molecular potentials are more suitable for these types of simulations, but they must be parameterized by some means. In this paper, we use a database of DFT calculations to train ReaxFF and a neural network potential. We compare and contrast these potentials with respect to their accuracy, trainability, and speed of calculation with application to properties of Au bulk, cluster and surface properties. There are clear tradeoffs with these two approaches, but both have advantages for different purposes. Congratulations Jake and Mitch! See the paper here: http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qua.25115.

Some time ago we published this paper on the coverage dependence of the adsorption energies of atomic adsorbates on different sites cite:xu-2014-probin-cover. One of the concerns in that work was whether van der Waal forces were significant for some adsorbates. Well, now we have addressed that concern in a new paper in Surface Science! In this new work we use the BEEF functional to simultaneously access the impact of van der Waal forces on the adsorption energy trends, as well as do some error analysis on the significance of the coverage dependence. I won't ruin the surprise too much; the good news is that yes van der Waals do influence adsorption of atomic adsorbates on metal surfaces, but the trends are mostly the same! See the paper for more details. Congratulations Hari!

We have a new publication in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. on the reactivity of different oxide polymorphs. In this work we examine the reactivity of some common BO_{2} oxide polymorphs for Ru, Rh, Pt and Ir oxides. These are all normally rutile formers, but it may be possible to synthesize them in other polymorphs as epitaxial films, or under pressure. We examined how the reactivity of the polymorphs would differ from that of the most stable phase, and the impact of those changes on the oxygen evolution reaction. We predict that the reactivity may be improved in some cases. Congratulations Zhongnan!

Predicting the relative stability of oxide polymorphs is critical to predicting which structures are likely to be experimentally observed. The energetics of TiO_{2} polymorphs are particularly challenging because the energies of the different polymorphs are relatively close together. Consequently, one predicts different relative stabilities using different exchange correlation functionals with DFT. In this paper, we show that DFT+U is able to give experimentally consistent relative orderings for the GGA functionals, and that linear response U can be used to predict a reasonable value of U.  Hybrid functionals can also do this for some ranges of the exact exchange fraction, but there is not yet a method to calculate from first-principles the amount of exact exchange required to achieve that. Notably, the U-values are pseudopotential and functional dependent.

This paper is open-access.

In this perspective we show an example of data sharing practices we have developed. We use the supporting information file from cite:boes-2015-estim-bulk to show how one can extract the data from our paper and reuse it for new purposes. We illustrate this for both computational and experimental data. We use org-mode for doing this, but we also show that data in the supporting information can be extracted using Python, and independently of Emacs, so that org-mode is not critical for people who do not use it.

In this paper we show that the electrolyte can  modify the reactivity of nickel hydroxide based electrodes for electrochemical water oxidation. There are two effects that are important: 1) Fe-impurities, and 2) the identify of the electrolyte cation. Fe-impurities are known to promote water oxidation. We found that a LiOH electrolyte can /suppress/ the oxygen evolution reaction, which is also known from the battery literature. KOH and CsOH are the best electrolytes for the OER on nickel hydroxide based electrodes.

In this collaborative paper we map out the electronic structure of a Cu-Pd alloy across composition space, and then correlate that electronic structure with the reactivity of the alloy. We experimentally measure the average energy of the filled valence band, and show it is similar to the calculated d-band center. We then show how those measured electronic structure properties correlate with the H_{2}\D_{2} exchange kinetics. The combination of experiments on composition spread alloy films (CSAF) and theory provides an integrated understanding of alloy reactivity in this system.

This landmark paper cite:norskov-2004-origin recently hit 1000+ citations! In this paper we lay out a framework using density functional theory to calculate the stabilities of intermediates in electrochemical processes such as fuel cells and electrolyzers. This was a very early use of electrochemical atomistic thermodynamics in which the electric potential and pH were both accounted for in the electrochemical reaction energies. We showed how the volcano plots frequently observed arise from trends in adsorption energies that are easily calculated. This paper also shows one of the earliest scaling relations between O and OH adsorption energies!

This paper came out shortly after I spent three months at DTU with Jens Nørskov when I was a PhD student. I still remember talking to him about the work that led to this paper one day at their regular afternoon department tea time. He suggested some DFT calculations that I knew how to do, and I went back to the office and worked on them the rest of the night. He wrote this amazing paper afterwards that has been cited over and over. Congratulations Jens! I am proud to have had a part in it.

*Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution with an Immobilized TAML Activator*

Ethan L. Demeter, Shayna L. Hilburg, Newell R. Washburn, Terrence J. Collins, and John R. Kitchin

Iron complexes of tetra-amido macrocyclic ligands are important members of the suite of oxidation catalysts known as TAML activators. TAML activators are known to be fast homogeneous water oxidation (WO) catalysts, producing oxygen in the presence of chemical oxidants, e.g., ceric ammonium nitrate. These homogeneous systems exhibited low turnover numbers (TONs). Here we demonstrate immobilization on glassy carbon and carbon paper in an ink composed of the prototype TAML activator, carbon black, and Nafion and the subsequent use of this composition in heterogeneous electrocatalytic WO. The immobilized TAML system is shown to readily produce O2 with much higher TONs than the homogeneous predecessors.

                  promising class of material for CO2 separations. In

                  synthesized and characterized with the aim of

                  illustrating the effects of substituents on the

*Identifying Potential BO2 Oxide Polymorphs for Epitaxial Growth Candidates*,
by Prateek Mehta, Paul A. Salvador, and John R. Kitchin
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/am4059149

Transition metal dioxides (BO2) exhibit a number of polymorphic structures with distinct properties, but the isolation of different polymorphs for a given composition is carried out using trial and error experimentation. We present computational studies of the relative stabilities and equations of state for six polymorphs (anatase, brookite, rutile, columbite, pyrite, and fluorite) of five different BO2 dioxides (B = Ti, V, Ru, Ir, and Sn). These properties were computed in a consistent fashion using several exchange correlation functionals within the density functional theory formalism, and the effects of the different functionals are discussed relative to their impact on predictive synthesis. We compare the computational results to prior observations of high-pressure synthesis and epitaxial film growth and then use this discussion to predict new accessible polymorphs in the context of epitaxial stabilization using isostructural substrates. For example, the relative stabilities of the columbite polymorph for VO2 and RuO2 are similar to those of TiO2 and SnO2, the latter two of which have been previously stabilized as epitaxial films.

As with other recent papers, the supporting information file contains embedded data files that enable the reproduction of the data and figures in the paper.

Simulating Temperature Programmed Desorption of Oxygen on Pt(111) Using DFT Derived Coverage Dependent Desorption Barriers

Abstract

The dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on Pt(111) is known to be coverage dependent. Simple Redhead analysis of temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments that assumes a coverage independent desorption barrier can lead to errors in estimated properties such as desorption barriers and adsorption energies. A simple correction is to assume a linear coverage dependence of the desorption barrier, but there is usually no formal justification given for that functional form. More advanced TPD analysis methods that are suitable for determining coverage dependent adsorption parameters are limited by their need for large amounts of high quality, low noise data. We present a method to estimate the functional form of the coverage dependent desorption barrier from density functional theory calculations for use in analysis of TPD spectra. Density functional theory was employed to calculate the coverage dependence of the adsorption energy. Simulated TPD spectra were then produced by empirically scaling the DFT based adsorption energies utilizing the Bronstead-Evans-Polyani relationship between adsorption energies and desorption barriers. The resulting simulated spectra show better agreement with the experimental spectra than spectra predicted using barriers that are either coverage-independent or simply linearly dependent on coverage. The empirically derived scaling of the desorption barriers for Pt(111) is shown to be useful in predicting the low coverage desorption barriers for oxygen desorption from other metal surfaces, which showed reasonable agreement with the reported experimental values for those other metals.

The [[http://link.springer.com/content/esm/art:10.1007/s11244-013-0166-3/file/MediaObjects/11244_2013_166_MOESM1_ESM.pdf][supporting information]] file is especially interesting because it has nearly all of the data files used in the paper embedded in it!

Relating the Electronic Structure and Reactivity of the 3d Transition Metal Monoxide Surfaces

    Zhongnan Xu, and  John R. Kitchin

We performed a series of density functional theory calculations of dissociative oxygen adsorption on fcc metals and their corresponding rocksalt monoxides to elucidate the relationship between the oxide electronic structure and its corresponding reactivity. We decomposed the dissociative adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of the adsorption energy on the metal and a change in adsorption energy caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We were able to identify the key features of the electronic structure that explains the trends in adsorption energies on 3d transition metal monoxide surfaces.

Our manuscript titled "Comparisons of Amine Solvents for Post-combustion CO$_2$ Capture: A Multi-objective Analysis Approach" by Anita Lee, John Eslick, David Miller, and John Kitchin was just accepted in International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control. In this paper we used a genetic algorithm to find pareto-optimal operating conditions of amine solvent CO2 capture systems that minimize capital cost and parasitic power cost. We compared MEA, DEA and AMP, and found that there are operating conditions where both solvents could be better than MEA.
