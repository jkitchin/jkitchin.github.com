;;; Commentary:

;; Drag a webpage onto a bibtex file to insert a bibtex entry. If the webpage is
;; known in `org-ref-scrape-doi', it will scrape a doi, and then use `doi-utils'
;; to insert a bibtex entry into the buffer.

;; You can add new scraper recipes to the variable `org-ref-url-scrapers'.

;;; Code:
(require 'doi-utils)
