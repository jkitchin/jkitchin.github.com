In the [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2016/03/26/A-molecule-link-for-org-mode/][last post]] we examined a molecule link to a src-block defining a molecule in some format. We blurred the distinction between program and data there. Here we re-separate them to try out some different ideas. We will use an [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks.html][org-mode special block]] to contain the "data" which is a molecular representation in some format. Then, we will use open-babel to convert the format to various other formats to explore using the data.

Here is a methane molecule (with 4 implicit hydrogens in the SMILES format). We put it in a named special block in org-mode, and even put a header on it to indicate the format and a display name!

#+CAPTION: A special MOLECULE block containing Methane in SMILES format.
#+header: :display-name methane
#+header: :format smiles
#+name: methane-smiles
#+BEGIN_MOLECULE
C
#+END_MOLECULE

We can use the SMILES representation block as input to a new command that converts it to the CML format, with coordinates. We use a simple shell command here and pass the contents of the molecule in as a variable. That is nice because in SMILES methane is represented by a single "C", and this CML is /much/ more verbose.

#+name: methane-cml
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var input=methane-smiles
echo $input | obabel -ismi -o cml --gen3d
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: methane-cml

 </bondArray>
</molecule>
#+end_example

We can also use the CML output as input to a command that generates an SVG image, again, passing the CML in via a variable in the header.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var cml=methane-cml :file methane.svg
echo $cml | obabel -icml -o svg
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:methane.svg]]

With our previous [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2016/03/26/A-molecule-link-for-org-mode/][molecule link]] we can refer to these in our text now as molecule:methane-smiles and molecule:methane-cml.

So far it all looks good. Let us do something new. We will use the SMILES representation to create an [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html][ase.atoms]] object in Python. First, we create an xyz format that =ase= can read. Rather than clutter up our document with the output, we silence it.

#+name: methane-xyz
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var input=methane-smiles :results silent
echo $input | obabel -ismi -o xyz --gen3d
#+END_SRC

Now, we can use the string generated in a Python file to generate a tempfile (or you could have saved the result above to a file and just read it in here). I was too lazy to make the file link to the image myself, so I setup a :file header and just print the result to stdout in this block. Although all we do here is create a new image, this demonstrates you can use data from a MOLECULE block and pass it into a Python script where other kinds of calculations might occur.


#+BEGIN_SRC python :var xyz=methane-xyz :file methane.png
from ase.io import read, write

from tempfile import mkstemp
fd, fname = mkstemp(suffix=".xyz")
with open(fname, 'w') as f:
    f.write(xyz)

atoms = read(fname)
write('-', atoms, format="png")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:methane.png]]


The last point to discuss is discoverability. It would be helpful if we could use a program to "extract" molecular information about the molecules we use in our work. Here is a block that will map over the MOLECULE blocks and summarize what is found with a common format (SMILES again). We generate a table of clickable links to each molecule found in the documents. There is a small appendix in this document containing molecule:h2o and molecule:caffeine that will show in this table.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mlc-to-smiles (blk)
  "Convert a molecule BLK to smiles format using openbabel."
  (let* ((headers (-flatten
		   (mapcar 'org-babel-parse-header-arguments
			   (org-element-property :header blk))))
	 (format (cdr (assoc :format headers)))
	 (content (buffer-substring-no-properties
		   (org-element-property :contents-begin blk)
		   (org-element-property :contents-end blk)))
	 (tempfile (make-temp-file "obabel-")))
    (with-temp-file tempfile
      (insert content))

    ;; convert to smiles. This outputs a smiles string and the file it was
    ;; generated from. I don't know how to suppress the file, so we use awk to
    ;; just get the SMILEs strings. It is not pretty. I know.
    (prog1
	(s-trim (shell-command-to-string
		 (format  "obabel %s %s -osmi 2> /dev/null | awk '{print $1}'"
			  (format "-i%s" format) tempfile)))
      (delete-file tempfile))))


;; Generate the table of molecules
(append '(("Display name" "Name" "format" "SMILES representation"))
	'(hline)
	(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'special-block
	  (lambda (sb)
	    (when (string= "MOLECULE" (org-element-property :type sb))
	      (let ((headers (-flatten
			      (mapcar 'org-babel-parse-header-arguments
				      (org-element-property :header sb)))))

		(list
		 (format "[[molecule:%s][%s]]" (org-element-property :name sb)
			 (cdr (assoc :display-name headers)))
		 (org-element-property :name sb)
		 (cdr (assoc :format headers))
		 (mlc-to-smiles sb)))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Display name | Name           | format | SMILES representation        |
|--------------+----------------+--------+------------------------------|
| [[molecule:methane-smiles][methane]]      | methane-smiles | smiles | C                            |

| [[molecule:caffeine][Caffeine]]     | caffeine       | xyz    | Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12 |

That seems pretty discoverable to me. We not only can discover the molecules in this post, but can pretty easily convert them to other formats (SMILES) in this case. Since we can run any code we want on them, we could just as well import them to a database, or do subsequent calculations on them.

The MOLECULE block is not standard, and I have only demonstrated here that it is suitable for this purpose. But, it looks like we could extend it and deal with a variety of formats. We can use headers to add metadata, format, etc... Some features I find missing are similar to those in code blocks where we can type C-c ' to edit them in special modes, and the nice syntax highlighting that often comes with that.

It might be helpful to make the export of MOLECULE blocks nicer looking and more functional. The default export, for example doesn't put an id attribute in the block. First, we rewrite an org-function to add the id attribute to the exported blocks so our molecule links will work.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-html-special-block (special-block contents info)
  "Transcode a SPECIAL-BLOCK element from Org to HTML.
CONTENTS holds the contents of the block.  INFO is a plist
holding contextual information."
  (let* ((block-type (downcase
		      (org-element-property :type special-block)))
	 (contents (or contents ""))
	 (html5-fancy (and (org-html-html5-p info)
			   (plist-get info :html-html5-fancy)
			   (member block-type org-html-html5-elements)))
	 (attributes (org-export-read-attribute :attr_html special-block)))
    (unless html5-fancy
      (let ((class (plist-get attributes :class)))
	(setq attributes (plist-put attributes :class
				    (if class (concat class " " block-type)
				      block-type)))
	(when (org-element-property :name special-block)
	  (setq attributes (plist-put
			    attributes :id
			    (org-element-property :name special-block))))))
    (setq attributes (org-html--make-attribute-string attributes))
    (when (not (equal attributes ""))
      (setq attributes (concat " " attributes)))
    (if html5-fancy
	(format "<%s%s>\n%s</%s>" block-type attributes
		contents block-type)
      (format "<div%s>\n%s\n</div>" attributes contents))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: org-html-special-block

It would be nice to add some additional information around the block, e.g. that it is a molecule, maybe some tooltip about the format, etc..., but we leave that to another day. These should probably be handled specially with a dedicated export function. You will note that MOLECULE blocks don't export too well, they should probably be wrapped in <pre> for HTML export. We will at least make them stand out with this bit of css magic.

** Summary thoughts
This looks pretty promising as a way to embed molecular data into org-files so that the data is reusable and discoverable. If there is metadata that cannot go into the MOLECULE format we can put it in headers instead. This seems like it could be useful.

* DONE A molecule link for org-mode

  :END:
Here I am exploring some ideas on compact and functional representations of molecules in org-mode. We will use some functionality from OpenBabel (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/index.html) for conversion of formats.

One approach we could use is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system][SMILES]] representation. OpenBabel provides tools to convert SMILES to a visualization like this. Let's check out an old favorite: caffeine.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
obabel -:"Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12" -osvg
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:out.svg]]

We can imagine the SMILES string is a program, and use an org-mode src block to contain it.  It isn't quite a program, as it is more like data, but we can make the block executable if we define how to "execute" the block, and for that we will just have obabel generate the svg representation of the molecule. Here is our execute function. It simply generates the svg to stdout. We can use a :file header to capture it in a file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-babel-execute:smiles (body params)
  (shell-command-to-string
   (format "obabel -:\"%s\" -osvg 2> /dev/null" body)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: org-babel-execute:smiles

You can find a smiles block in [[id:1CD759B4-E276-4990-982C-E98CCE5B0517][Appendix of molecules]] that was adapted from [[http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/smiles_examples.html][here]].

Now, we need a link to refer to our molecule. We want the follow action to jump to our src block which should have a name. We will have it export as the name of the block linked to the molecule definition. This should work fine for definitions in the document. It is not robust to link to molecules in other org-files in the export. That would require those files to be exported too. For now we just define an HTML export.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun molecule-jump (name)
  (org-mark-ring-push)
  (org-open-link-from-string (format "[[%s]]" path)))

(defun molecule-export (path desc backend)
  (let ((name (save-window-excursion
		(molecule-jump path)
		(org-element-property :name (org-element-context)))))
    (cond

Now we link to molecule:LSD and molecule:ethanol that allows us to navigate to the definition. We can also refer to a molecule in another file like molecule:./blog.org::LSD. The links are clickable, and should jump to the molecule definition. On export to HTML they will be links to the definition.

Our link provides some limited functionality. We can provide more by making the follow action open a menu for example. Instead, we created a major mode [[id:7978044B-CB2F-4AB3-8142-34A28B3DB201][here]]. It provides a function to convert smiles to CML. It is readily extensible to do other conversions.

One of the reasons we want to have molecules as "data" is so we can find them in our papers. Here is an example of that. We defined two molecules in the Appendix, and we find them here.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer)
    'src-block
  (lambda (src)
    (when (string= "smiles" (org-element-property :language src))
      (org-element-property :name src))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| LSD | ethanol |

There is still a lot to do to make this really functional. For example, we might want to use the molecules to write reactions. We might also want more advanced conversion or lookup functions, and more export options. It might be desirable to have tooltips on the links to see the molecules too. No doubt one might want to fine-tune the way the blocks run, so that options could be passed as header args.
Maybe I will work on that another day.

It would be nice to have a language mode to do special edits of SMILES src blocks. This mode does very little but provide a function that converts SMILES to CML using obabel and open it in a buffer. We redirect stderr to /dev/null to avoid seeing the messages from obabel. We also provide another function that opens a browser to names of the molecule.

The [[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html#ase-db][ase-db]] has a command-line interface, a Python API, and a web-based interface. None of these do everything I would like at once. Here we investigate an Emacs interface to the ase-db using ivy. This will give us the power of the command-line interface with the selection and multiple actions of ivy.

First, we make a little database to play with.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import os
if os.path.exists('abc.db'): os.unlink('abc.db')

from ase import Atoms
from ase.db import connect
c = connect('abc.db')

c.write(Atoms('Fe'))
c.write(Atoms('Al'))
c.write(Atoms('Ni'))
c.write(Atoms('FeNi'))
c.write(Atoms('FeAl'))
c.write(Atoms('NiAl'))
c.write(Atoms('FeNiAl'))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

Now, let us see the contents to be sure what is in there. Each row of this output is a candidate we might want to do something with.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ase-db abc.db
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We can split this pretty cleanly. For candidates we can ignore the first row, and the last two rows.

** SQL interactions
Now, suppose I want to find entries that do not contain Ni. We can find the entries that do contain Ni like this.

#+begin_src sqlite :db abc.db :list
SELECT species.id  FROM species
WHERE species.Z == 28;
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3
: 4
: 6
: 7

You can see there is a Ni in each found entry. Now, we select the ids from the systems table that do not exist in that list.

#+begin_src sqlite :db abc.db :list
select id from  systems
 where
   NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM species WHERE species.id = systems.id and species.Z == 28);
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1
: 2
: 5

And you can see none of these entries contain Ni.






** python + sql

I am examining how to query the ase-db, and this post looks at how to find results that do not contain a particular atom. The solution is based on a email from the mailing list (http://listserv.fysik.dtu.dk/pipermail/ase-developers/2014-April/002097.html).

We begin by making a test database. This will only contain some atoms objects with different stoichiometries. We also add keywords for the stoichiometry, because the queries will be developed directly in SQL, which cannot read the numpy arrays stored in the tables.


It is probably more common to interact with the ase-db using Python.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from ase.db import connect

c = connect('abc.db')
con = c._connect()
cur = con.cursor()
for row in  cur.execute('''select * from  systems
 where
   NOT EXISTS (SELECT id FROM species WHERE species.id = systems.id and species.Z == 28)'''):
    print(row)

* DONE Org teleport headlines
  CLOSED: [2016-03-18 Fri 08:48]

  :END:
I often want to rearrange org headlines.  There are super convenient shortcuts for some things, like Alt-up/down to move up and down, and Alt-left/right to change levels, and shift variants of that when there are nested headlines. There is also refile for some use cases. The case these don't handle for me is when I have a headline at the bottom and I want to move it a distance. To cut down on key strokes, I usually kill the headline, jump to where I want, and paste it.

In lispy, there is a teleport command for this! I am going to adapt this here for reorganizing org-headlines. This version allows you to move headlines around on the visible area. You need another strategy for the candidates to jump to if you want to move a headline off the screen. Note though that ivy is really smart, you can have one file in a split view and it will jump to any headline in any window! I use ivy for the navigation here, but you could also use helm to select headlines, for example. This function puts your headline after the selected headline, unless you use a prefix arg, and then it goes before.

Check out the video to see this in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv-2888rpyc

Note: this code is a little more advanced than what is in the video; I added a numeric prefix to change the headline level.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-teleport (&optional arg)
  "Teleport the current heading to after a headline selected with avy.
With a prefix ARG move the headline to before the selected
headline. With a numeric prefix, set the headline level. If ARG
is positive, move after, and if negative, move before."
  (interactive "P")
  ;; Kill current headline
  (org-mark-subtree)
  (kill-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
  ;; Jump to a visible headline
  (avy-with avy-goto-line (avy--generic-jump "^\\*+" nil avy-style))

Now we add some new speed commands to help us out. I think we should be able to mark subtrees ("@" is bound to this, but I like "m" better) and kill them with a key stroke, in addition to teleporting them. Since we figured out the nice way to jump to a headline up there, we bind that to "q" which isn't used so far, and maps to a similar concept in lispy. The lowercase "t" is already bound to changing the TODO state, so we use capital "T" for the speed key to teleport. Note it is possible to "compose" the same effect by typing "k" to kill a headline, then "q" to jump somewhere else (or navigate where you want,  and then "C-y" to paste it at the new location. Or, "T".

It has always bothered me a little that I have to add a file image after code blocks in org-mode to see the results. That extra work... I also don't like having to explicitly print the figure in the code, since that is the extra work, just in a different place. Today I look into two approaches to this. First, we consider something like tooltips, and second just putting overlays of image files right on the file name. The plus side of this is no extra work. The downside is they won't export; that will still take the extra work, but you needed that for the caption anyway for now.

Here is a video illustrating the code in this post: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuAnwCERM0U

Here is a test.

** Tooltip approach
Building on our [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2016/03/16/Getting-graphical-feedback-as-tooltips-in-Emacs/][previous approach]] of graphical tooltips, we try that here to show the images. I have solved the issue of why the images didn't show in the tooltips before; it was related to how Emacs was built. I used to build it with "cocoa" support so it integrates well in OSX. Here, I have build it with gtk3, and the tooltips work with images.

Now these both have tooltips on them: "test-fig.png"  and  'test-fig.png'.

** The overlay approach

We might alternatively prefer to put overlays in the buffer. Here we make that happen.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun next-image-overlay (&optional limit)
  (when (re-search-forward image-tooltip-re limit t)
    (setq beg (match-beginning 0)
	  end (match-end 0)
	  imgfile (match-string 1))
    (when (file-exists-p imgfile)
      (setq img (create-image (expand-file-name imgfile)
			      'imagemagick nil :width 300))
      (setq ov (make-overlay beg end))
      (overlay-put ov 'display img)
      (overlay-put ov 'face 'default)
      (overlay-put ov 'org-image-overlay t)
      (overlay-put ov 'modification-hooks
		   (list 'org-display-inline-remove-overlay)))))

(font-lock-add-keywords
 nil
 '((next-image-overlay (0  'font-lock-keyword-face t)))
 t)
#+END_SRC


Here is the example we looked at before.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([-0, 1, 2, 4, 16])
plt.savefig("test-fig.png")
#+END_SRC

You may want to remove those overlays. Here is one way. Note they come back if you don't disable the font-lock keywords though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ov-clear 'org-image-overlay)
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:

I know you want to do that so here is:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(font-lock-remove-keywords
 nil
 '((next-image-overlay (0  'font-lock-keyword-face t))))

(ov-clear 'org-image-overlay)
#+END_SRC


Note you still have to clear the overlays. Font lock doesn't seem to do that for you I think.

We write a lot of Python code in org-mode. In python-mode TAB does nice things like indenting code, and we would like that in org-mode too. The problem is org-mode also makes heavy use of TAB for too many other useful things to give it up. What we really want is TAB to act differently in Python blocks, and the same everywhere else.

Enter the [[http://endlessparentheses.com/define-context-aware-keys-in-emacs.html][context aware keybindings]]. We bind a menu-item to TAB that uses a filter function to determine what it does. If the filter function evaluates to t then it is run, and otherwise the usual meaning of TAB is used. There is also the convenient function =org-babel-do-key-sequence-in-edit-buffer= which will let us make TAB act like it does in python-mode!

While we are improving things... Ken Mankoff on the org-mode mailing list pointed out this gem for commenting in src blocks: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2013-11/msg00318.html.

* TODO Equation image tooltips over LaTeX fragments in org-mode
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       603BDAF5-59DA-48F4-97F7-4C19F00AAE80
  :categories: emacs,orgmode
  :END:

This post has one  goal: to fontify LaTeX fragments in org-mode and make tooltips with the rendered equations. I previously looked at doing something like this with the [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/10/09/Automatic-latex-image-toggling-when-cursor-is-on-a-fragment/][cursor]], but now I want to try with the mouse.

=org-latex-regexps= contains regexp patterns We will use those to build a function that matches fragments, and puts some text properties on the match to make them clickable. What we need to do then, is make a function for font-lock that will put a tool tip on our fragments, and generate the image for us on the fly. I am going to set a property containing the fragment string on the text during font-lock, and we will use that property in the tool-tip. So, first the tooltip function. We store the images in calculatable names so we can reuse them. We also provide options to make the images larger so they are easier to see.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun latex-fragment-tooltip (object window position)
  (save-excursion
    (goto-char position)
    (let* ((f (concat temporary-file-directory
		      "latex-tooltip-"
		      (md5 (get-text-property (point) 'latex-fragment))
		      ".png"))
	   (png))
      (unless (file-exists-p f)
	(message "creating image for %s. Please wait."
		 (get-text-property (point) 'latex-fragment))
	(org-create-formula-image
	 (get-text-property (point) 'latex-fragment)
	 f
	 '(:foreground default :background default
		       :scale 4.0 :html-foreground "Black"
		       :html-background "Transparent" :html-scale 4.0
		       :matchers
		       ("begin" "$1" "$" "$$" "\\(" "\\["))
	 (current-buffer)
	 org-latex-create-formula-image-program)
	(message ""))
      (propertize
       " " 'display
       (create-image f)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: latex-fragment-tooltip

Now, we need to propertize the fragments. We use one function for that here, and this function will be called via font-lock. Basically we just put the fragment as a property for easy retrieval by the tooltip function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun propertize-fragment ()
  (put-text-property
   (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)
   'latex-fragment (match-string-no-properties 0))
  (put-text-property
   (match-beginning 0) (match-end 0)
   'help-echo 'latex-fragment-tooltip))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: propertize-fragment

Now a series of functions to propertize different types of LaTeX fragments. The regexps are approximately those found in org-latex-regexps, but not exactly. I found those caused some org-eldoc errors in these src blocks presumably from the non-ascii characters in them. They don't cause problems otherwise.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun next-latex-overlay-1 (limit)
  "Overlay images on \(eqn\) up to LIMIT."
  (while (re-search-forward "\\\\(.*?\\\\)" limit t)
    (propertize-fragment)))

(defun next-latex-overlay-2 (limit)
  "Overlay images on \[eqn\] up to LIMIT."
  (while (re-search-forward "\\\\\\[.*?\\\\\\]" limit t)
    (propertize-fragment)))

(defun next-latex-overlay-3 (limit)
  "Overlay images on $$eqn$$ up to LIMIT."
  (while (re-search-forward "\\$\\$[^$]*?\\$\\$" limit t)
    (propertize-fragment)))

(defun next-latex-overlay-4 (limit)
  "Overlay images on $eqn$ up to LIMIT.
this is less robust than useing \(\)"
  (while (re-search-forward "\\b\\$[^$]+?\\$\\b" limit t)
    (propertize-fragment)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: next-latex-overlay-4

Finally, add the font lock keywords.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(font-lock-add-keywords
 nil
 '((next-latex-overlay-1 0 font-lock-keywords)
   (next-latex-overlay-2 0 font-lock-keywords)
   (next-latex-overlay-3 0 font-lock-keywords)
   (next-latex-overlay-4 0 font-lock-keywords)))
#+END_SRC

Now, we get tooltips of equation images!

\[\int_0^x 500 dx\]

1. $e^{x^2}$

2. $$\exp{x^2}$$

3. \(\frac{2}{3x}\)

4. \[\log{4x}\]

This is primarily limited to one line equations that are easily matched.

* TODO Lispy navigation in Python mode
  :PROPERTIES:
  :categories: emacs,python
  :END:
I am not going to sugar coat this. Editing emacs-lisp code with lispy beats the pants off editing python in any mode I have tried so far. What is so great about it? modal navigation and editing. Lispy recognizes some special locations, e.g. the beginning of a sexp, and makes hotkeys active at these positions. So, you can use [ and ] to navigate by sexp, and a boatload of hotkeys like n to make a new copy, or c to clone, or a to enter an ace-mode to jump to an open parenthesis, and [[http://oremacs.com/lispy/][many, many others]]. I have gotten used to it. I want it in python-mode.

I want my python-mode to have hotkeys at the beginning of def, blocks and statements so I can easily jump to the next one, mark it, copy it, clone it, move it, etc.... @AMalabarba wrote an interesting blog post on [[http://endlessparentheses.com/define-context-aware-keys-in-emacs.html][context-aware keybindings]] that I am going to use extensively to achieve this. The idea is to define keys that do things differently depending on the context. Here if the cursor is at the beginning of a def, then when I press n i want to go to the next def, but if I am at the beginning of a block, I want the next block, at the beginning of a statement the next statement, and anywhere else, I want to type the letter n.

Here are the current hotkey definitions I have defined for python-mode. The code is relatively long so if you find this interesting, you should check it out here (https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax/blob/master/lispypy.el). I have just started using these, so most likely I will be finding bugs and fixing them in the future ;)

Here is a summary of the hotkeys. You should probably just watch this video to see them in action:

| hotkey | action                                         |

* TODO Parsing sexps in plain text and putting overlays on them
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       480C2539-01DE-42B9-B835-FC1E6489142D
  :END:

I am exploring a kind of richer markup here to put context into plain text using sexp notation instead of [[http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/][RDF]] notation. RDF notation is just heavy for an author to write. Sexp notation, on the other hand, is lighter in my opinion. You can even imagine this relatively readable markup being code in addition to data (see this [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/06/10/A-sexp-version-of-a-bibtex-entry/][post]] on a sexp notation for bibtex for example).

I will use Emacs overlays to hide the sexp and display the contents. For example, say we markup a "person" like this @(:person "John Kitchin" :email "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"). It seems in this approach it is necessary to put strings in quotes because we eventually read these sexps into lisp. I want Emacs to find these, and replace it with an overlay of a more human readable content, and some contextual tooltip about the real content.

For fun, let us see if we can nest a sexp in the sexp, here to have some code that constructs an email address. For example, (:person "John" :email (concat "jkitchin" "@cmu.edu")) has code to build the email address. This works, but the code is not actually executed anywhere. You would have to do that somewhere else.

Ok, here is a little code block that "renders" our buffer to show the person entries with an overlay. This is kind of like what a browser would do with html tags, but with my lispy markup. Here we rely on a particular data structure that we know in advance. We could probably be smarter about it, and check that there is a :person in the sexp, but for now we keep it simple, and make that be the car of the sexp. We will make an overlay of the name in angle brackets with an underline to indicate it is not the original text, and make a tooltip of the contents.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ov)

(save-excursion
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (while (and  (re-search-forward "@(" nil t)
	       (sexp-at-point))
    (let ((beg)
	  (end)
	  (sexp))
      (backward-char)
      (setq beg (point))
      (setq sexp (read (current-buffer)))
      (when (and (listp sexp)
		 (eq :person (car (sexp-at-point))))
	(scan-sexps (point) 1)
		(setq end (point))
	(ov beg end 'help-echo (format "%S" sexp)
	    'face '(:underline t)
	    'display (concat "<" (plist-get sexp :person) ">")
	    'person t)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

That seems to work nicely. We can remove the overlays like this we can see the plain text.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ov-clear 'person)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

One reason for doing this, is the possibility of machine reading documents to extract data. Let's get the "people" out of this document.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(save-excursion
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (let ((beg)
	(end)
	(sexp)
	(people '()))
    (while (and  (re-search-forward "(" nil t)
		 (sexp-at-point))
      (backward-char)
      (setq beg (point))
      (setq sexp (read (current-buffer)))
      (when (and (listp sexp)
		 (eq :person (car (sexp-at-point))))
	(add-to-list 'people sexp)))
    people))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| :person | John         | :email | (concat jkitchin @cmu.edu) |
| :person | John Kitchin | :email | jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu    |

Now, we have a nice list of "persons" we can do something with, e.g. add them to an org-contacts database, send a mail merge, etc... For sufficiently complex data structures, there might be some functions to help insert them. Let us do show a simple example to insert a "person" from a name in my org-contacts database.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun insert-person (name)
  "Insert a person sexp for the NAME entry in `org-contacts-db'."
  (interactive "sName: ")
  (let ((contact (assoc name (org-contacts-db)))
	(p '()))
    (when contact
      (setq p (plist-put p :person (substring-no-properties(car contact))))
      (setq p (plist-put p :email (cdr (assoc "EMAIL" (nth 2 contact)))))
      (insert (format "%S" p)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: insert-person


No doubt there are potential security issues with this. You would not want to do this with untrusted documents. But, with trusted documents, what an amazing opportunity to do something that is just not possible otherwise! This is like the best of both worlds in text, where you get easy authoring of some parts, the text part, and machine-readability in the data parts, which also look pretty readable, especially after the overlays.

You would need some kind of way to know how to render any things marked up this way. These are usually called [[http://www.w3schools.com/schema/][schemas]], and somewhere in the document you would put some kind of information about that. This could range from code that loads the overlay library, e.g. (:schema 'person), or some kind of url that defines the schema, e.g. (:schema "http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu/person"). I have not thought too much about this point yet.

There are some related ideas around, e.g. [[http://racket-lang.org][racket]] and its scribble extension. [[http://www.dexy.it][dexy]] is a project that lets you embed code in documents that can be rendered in different outputs. Over on oremacs there is a project called [[http://oremacs.com/2015/01/23/eltex/][eltex]] where a LaTeX document is written totally in emacs-lisp. We previously  wrote about [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/02/05/Extending-the-org-mode-link-syntax-with-attributes/][org-mode links with attributes]]. There is also the linked text library [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/linkd.el][linkd.el]] that provides a syntax for making sexps in text clickable. That package is especially interesting because, among many other things, it ties sexps into font-lock to automatically recognize them, and it provides some export support to other formats, making it possible to do some preprocessing to handle the sexps, and then to have an org-mode export. This package definitely needs more study!


Why not use html/xml for this kind of markup? There are some strong opinions out there, including http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LispVsXml and https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/xml-or-s-expressions/. Here the bottom line is we can integrate the sexp notation pretty well with the editor we are using; it natively speaks them, unlike those other MLs.

Ivy is a new completion engine for Emacs. It comes as part of [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][swiper]]. It is an alternative to helm, which I have used a lot in org-ref. Here we consider an approach to use ivy in org-ref for inserting citations. We will develop an ivy command to query a bibtex file, and either insert a citation, open the entry or the PDF file.

With any completion framework, you need a list of candidates. org-ref provides an alist of citation strings, and all the fields of the corresponding bibtex entry. For example, here is the first entry.

We use the string to narrow down our selection. Depending on the completion tool, the fields usually get sent to some kind of action function. Upon selection, we will need a few actions:
1. Insert a citation
2. Open the bibtex entry
3. Open the pdf of the entry.


First, an insert citation function. This will take a bibtex entry from ivy, and insert a citation. This is only moderately advanced; if you are on a citation, or at the end or beginning, the selected key is inserted appropriately at the end of the citation, and if not a new citation is inserted.

#+RESULTS:

When you run this command, you get an ivy selection buffer. Start typing some words to find what you want, and press enter to insert the citation.

Alternatively, when you have selected what you want type C-m. This is notable because if you type C-M-m, the selection buffer stays open and you can take advantage of this to insert several citations in succession.

If you forget what the actions are, type M-o and you will get a hydra menu of the actions. See what you want in the selection window? Type C-', and you get an avy like completion where one letter will make the final selection.

C-o will open a hydra menu for navigation and selection.

Overall, ivy seems like an interesting alternative for org-ref. I need to refactor some things in org-ref to enable easier switching between completion engines.  Currently, you can choose between these cite insertion engines:

- org link completion
- reftex
- helm-bibtex
- org-ref-helm-cite
- ivy

[[https://www.vasp.at][VASP]] outputs a lot of its data in XML. Here we examine that output in Python and emacs-lisp to see how easy it is to use it. Where feasible, this is probably better than trying to parse the text-based OUTCAR file.

The XML is organized in "sections". Here, we look at the top level sections in the [[./vasprun.xml]] file. This particular file is from a CuPd alloy calculation I ran a long time ago.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

: <Element 'calculation' at 0x102963610>

Now, let us look at the elements in the generator element. We are just exploring for now.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

    vasprun_xml = f.read()

The generator element contains information about the VASP executable, version and computer platform the calculation was run on. We can extract this information in the next section. We "find" an element with an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath][xpath]] which allows you to write something like a path to the node containing the information, including specifying the attributes of a node. Pretty sweet.

Next, we see about the incar element. This contains the entries you used in the INCAR.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

There are a whole bunch of things in the parameters element. Most of these are either default values or properties of the calculation. Here we look at the number of electrons, and the value of the [[http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/wiki/index.php/AMIX][AMIX]] parameter in the electronic mixer.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session

There is a lot more information in the vasprun.xml file. It takes some exploration to figure out what is there, and how to get it. I am not aware of any documentation on this file anywhere. But, it seems a lot easier to extract data from this than to parse the OUTCAR file.

That is definitely a bit more verbose than the Python code, but I suspect that is because it uses lower level functions. The main thing missing here is the use of xpath in emacs-lisp.

Let's see if we can get a little closer to the Python syntax. First, we break down the parsed xml a bit. The returned value of xml-parse-file is a list of elements, in this case, it is one element named modeling. That element contains everything else.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results code
(loop for element in  (xml-parse-file "vasprun.xml")
      collect (xml-node-name element))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(modeling)
#+END_SRC

Now, lets see what is in modeling. The modeling element is nested in the output of xml-parse-file, and I guess it is conceivable there could be more than one of them. Let us be general and allow for that. We create a lambda function that takes a node, and then collects the name of any children nodes. It is possible the child node is a string, in which case it is the "text" of the element. We only want to collect container nodes here, which are lists. We use our lambda function to loop over each element in the output of xml-parse-file, and on that element, examine the child nodes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results code
(mapcar
 (lambda (node)
   (loop for element in  (xml-node-children node)
	 when (listp element)
	 collect (xml-node-name element)))
 (xml-parse-file "vasprun.xml"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
((generator incar kpoints parameters atominfo structure calculation structure))
#+END_SRC

Here I just wrap a function to make it a little cleaner.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value raw
(defun collect-children-names (parent)
  (loop for element in  (xml-node-children parent)
	   when (listp element)
	   collect (xml-node-name element)))

(mapcar
 'collect-children-names
 (xml-parse-file "vasprun.xml"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
((generator incar kpoints parameters atominfo structure calculation structure))

Ok, that gives us an idea of the secondary structure.  The returned structure is a list containing a list of symbols. One more example. Let's now consider what is in the generator. Let us refresh our mental model of the data. We start with a list containing one modeling element, which is itself a list. The modeling element contains a generator element, which is a list containing other elements.

((modeling (generator (node1) (node2))))

So, when we work on the parent xml, we will get an outer list containing a list of a list of generators for each modeling element in the file. Sounds confusing! We can just flatten our list to level two!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun collect-children-names (parent)
  (loop for element in  (xml-node-children parent)
	   when (listp element)
	   collect (cons (xml-node-name element) (cdr element))))

(collect-children-names
 (-flatten-n 2(loop for modeling in (xml-parse-file "vasprun.xml")
		    collect (loop for generator in (xml-get-children modeling 'generator)
				  collect (xml-node-children generator)))))

I want to be able to save state data to a file from Emacs, and read it in later, possible after Emacs has been closed and re-opened. Here we document how to save the results to a file, and then later read them in. First, say we have a list containing a string, and we want to write it to disk. We will use the print function [[elisp:(describe-function 'print)]] for this. The basic strategy is to print the variable to a buffer that is written to file. Later, we can read the data in.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq assignments '("one"))
(with-temp-file "state.el"
  (print assignments (current-buffer)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| one |

Now, to read it back, we will load the file in a buffer, and then use the [[elisp:(describe-function 'read)]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-current-buffer (find-file "state.el")
 (read (current-buffer)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| two | one |

We can add to the list, and update the file easy enough.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'assignments "two")

(with-temp-file "state.el"
  (print assignments (current-buffer)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

And, checking the results:

  (read (current-buffer)))

I like the symmetry of code and data in Emacs-lisp. There might be some advantages to using a structured data format other than Emacs Lisp data/code. One of them is interoperability with other programs. If there are subprograms that need to analyze the data in Python, for example. Here we consider json as a data format. We can write the data like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'json)

(with-temp-file "this.json"
  (let ((data   '(:title   "the title"
			   :author  "John Kitchin"
			   :email   "jkitchin@cmu.edu")))
    (insert (json-encode-plist data))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

It is simple enough to read the json data back in. Note, this reads in as an a-list by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'json)
(cdr (assoc 'email (json-read-file "this.json")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: jkitchin@cmu.edu

To get the json read in another form, we have to temporarily define the json-object-type variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'json)
(let ((json-object-type 'plist))
  (plist-get (json-read-file "this.json") :email))
#+END_SRC

I have some time to kill in an airport, so I am going to explore saving a few variable to file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((x 1)
      (y 2))
  (with-temp-file "multi-values.el"
    (print x (current-buffer))
    (print y (current-buffer))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2

Now, I presume we have to do two reads to get those values back.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let (a b)
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents "multi-values.el")
    (setq a (read (current-buffer)))
    (setq b (read (current-buffer))))
(list a b))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Indeed. That is exactly what we do. The downside of this is you must know in advance the data structure, and read it in the same way. That is reminiscent of binary data structures from Fortran or C. That probably is not too flexible to changes in data structure. For example, you can only add data to the end of the structure if you need to maintain backward compatibility.

There are a few options for saving and reading data in different structures and formats. I did not explore very complex data structures here, e.g. deeply nested data, or different types of data within one structure. I still have not completely internalized best practices in writing/reading data. There are several approaches that all involve getting the data into a buffer. That can be done with find-file, or find-file-noselect, or with temp-buffers and insert-file-contents. I do not know which of these approaches are the best. Apparently find-file affects other things such as recent-files, and the buffer list, which may be undesirable. Emacs treats this very differently than Python, where you can simply open a file, and read it to get a string (the closest Python has to a buffer concept are related to StringIO). Interestingly, the json-read-file function uses a temp-buffer, inserts the file contents, and then reads the data. The code resembles this block:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun read-file (file)
  "Read contents of a FILE into a string"
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents file)
    (buffer-string)))

We need to design a database scheme. Each headline will have an ID. On saving an org-file, we need to do the following:

1. delete entries from the database that no longer exist.
2. update entries that do exist
3. add new entries that don't exist

Might nees some escaping mechanism for some text.

Org-mode is made for that kind of thing, but we have to implement it ourselves. We just need to define a function that sets the property. The only subtle points in this are that properties are defined as strings, and we have to put a string in the property. That means we have to convert the string to a number, increment it, and convert it back to a string. We also add an org-mode speed command to + so when our cursor is at the beginning of the headline, we just press + to increment the VOTES property.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun plusone ()
  "Increase the VOTES property in an org-heading by one. Create
the property if needed."
  (interactive)
  (org-entry-put
   (point)
   "VOTES"
   (format "%s" (+ 1 (string-to-number
		      (or
		       (org-entry-get (point) "VOTES")
		       "0"))))))

(add-to-list 'org-speed-commands-user '("+" . (plusone)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| + | quote | plusone |

Now some test headlines. We can use the agenda to filter headlines. Here is the agenda command that is equivalent to the key sequence "C-c a < m". Type in VOTES>2, for example, to see headlines that have more than two votes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

This is a generic idea that I am using org-headlines as containers for data, and frequently want some way to interact with collections, to add new headlines, etc... I find it awkward to use org-entry-get all the time. I am thinking of a generic function that would return a data structure.

Here I work it out for a contact.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defclass Contact ()
  ((email :initarg :email
	  :documentation "The email address")
   (birthday :initarg :birthday
	     :documentation "An org-timestamp for the birthdate."))
  "A contact")

(defmethod get-email ((contact Contact))
  (oref contact email))

(let ((c (Contact nil :email "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu" :birthday [2015-10-20 Tue])))
  (oref c birthday))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [2015-10-20 Tue]


Here is a struct approach where we map over the headlines that have a BIRTHDAY property and make a struct out them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(cl-defstruct Contact name marker properties)

(let ((contacts (org-map-entries
		 (lambda ()
		   (make-Contact
		    :name (org-get-heading t t)
		    :marker (point-marker)
		    :properties (org-entry-properties (point) 'all)))
		 "BIRTHDAY<>\"\"")))
  (mapcar 'Contact-name contacts))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| John | Jane |

Now, we convert a headline to a alist.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-headline-to-alist ()
  (append
   (list
    (org-get-heading t t)
    (cons "MARKER" (point-marker)))

I came across this question on Emacs StackExchange: http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18644/org-mode-customize-link-display on how to make descriptive links in org-ref more helpful. The problem is that org-mode makes the citation part invisible, and only shows the description, which org-ref uses for pre/post text. There is a partial solution on stack exchange, which I have adapted here to make these special links visible so you can see the key and the pre/post text.

Basically, we just undo the invisibility after the link has been activated, and then add the color back in a function that advises the activate link function. Here is the solution I have put into org-ref.

An important detail:
1. It was important to save the match data, because it is reused in subsequent font-lock functions in org-mode. The match-data gets changed by the string-match function.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun org-ref-make-org-link-cite-key-visible (&rest _)
  "Make the org-ref cite link visible in descriptive links."

  (save-match-data
    (let ((s (match-string 1))
	  (beg (match-beginning 0))
	  (end (match-end 0))
	  (cite-re (format "^\\(%s:\\)"
			   (regexp-opt (-sort
					(lambda (a b)
					  (> (length a) (length b)))
					org-ref-cite-types))))
	  cite-type)

      (when (and s (string-match cite-re s))
	(setq cite-type (match-string 1 s))
	(remove-text-properties beg end
				'(invisible))
	(add-text-properties
	 beg end
	 `(face (:foreground ,org-ref-cite-color)))))))

* Autoload languages in org-mode

You normally have to "register" languages in org-mode in the variable `org-babel-load-languages'. Here, we advise org-babel-execute-src-block to check for the language, make sure it is loaded, and if not load it. Basically we just need to get the language type, check if it is in org-babel-load-languages, add it if not and then load the languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defadvice org-babel-execute-src-block (around load-language nil activate)
  "Load language if needed"
  (let ((language (org-element-property :language (org-element-at-point))))
    (unless (cdr (assoc (intern language) org-babel-load-languages))
      (add-to-list 'org-babel-load-languages (cons (intern language) t))
      (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages org-babel-load-languages))

* A python version of CaPPA
The idea here is to replicate the Melpa code in Python and some static blog framework like Nikola to build the preprint. This would allow a bibtex entry to be the recipe, and allow me to use more sophisticated template engines to render the pages.

Then, we define the same key as before, but instead of just passing the command we use a menu-item bound to nil. The fact that it’s a menu-item is irrelevant here, it behaves exactly like a key bound to nil (i.e., an empty keybind). However, this allows us to setup
a filter that changes the keybind to endless/round-quotes if we’re not inside an org-src-block.

* Finding and handling duplicate bibtex entries :bibtex:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       1590FA44-91F3-4093-99C8-82726353DDDB
  :END:
Duplicate bibtex entries in your bibtex file is a problem. Finding them is tricky because minor spelling differences, differences in capitalization, etc... make it difficult to use code to find duplicates. I find it good practice to keep your bibtex file sorted, so that duplicates tend to be near each other, and hence easier to spot. But with a large number of entries, this is still tedious to do.

I have been trying to learn more about the bibtex.el library, so I am going to use this opportunity to write some code for duplicate detection. The idea is to go through each entry, generate a key for it, and see if the key has already been generated. bibtex comes with bibtex-generate-autokey for generating keys automatically.

Here is my bibtex autokey setup. This is a reasonable balance (for me) of almost always generating new keys that are not too long, and with enough information to often tell which reference it is. Every once in a while there are title/author/year combinations that are close enough that the same key is generated, but it is not too frequent.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; variables that control bibtex key format for auto-generation
;; I want firstauthor-year-title-words
(setq bibtex-autokey-year-length 4
      bibtex-autokey-name-year-separator "-"
      bibtex-autokey-year-title-separator "-"
      bibtex-autokey-titleword-separator "-"
      bibtex-autokey-titlewords 2
      bibtex-autokey-titlewords-stretch 1
      bibtex-autokey-titleword-length 5)
#+END_SRC

So, we will just map over our entries looking for places where the same key is generated. We will save markers to these, and generate a clickable link to jump to the places where we suspect duplicates. We will temporarily redefine the key algorithm to make longer, less likely to be the same, keys.

  :END:

org-ref has a function org-ref-extract-bibtex-entries that uses reftex to build a bibliography from an exported LaTeX file. I have learned a lot since I wrote that code, and in this post illustrate how to avoid the lengthy export process, and use mostly org-mode and built in bibtex functions to extract a bibtex file from org-ref citations.

This paragraph contains a single citation cite:goedecker-2004-minim. A
multicitation cite:kitchin-2002-molyb,kitchin-2004-tunin-the and some articles

To extract the bibtex entries, we get all the unique keys in the buffer that we have cited.

Next we get data structures for each entry in the bibtex files. We will use this to construct the new bibtex file. Here is an example of an a-list we can use. Note, we use add-to-list here, so duplicate keys will be problematic; the second entry will not be included. Since you don't have duplicate entries (right ;) this won't be a big problem.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun get-bibtex-entry-a-list ()

  :END:
Sometimes I am reading a document with citations from org-ref in it, and I want to copy the bibtex entry for that link from the file it is in to a new file. Right now, I have to click on the link, open the entry, copy the file, open the new file, and paste it. Here we develop a function that does all that.

Some functions will help us with this. First, org-ref-open-citation-at-point will open the bibtex file with the point in the entry. Second, bibtex-copy-entry-as-kill will copy the entry to the bibtex-entry-kill-ring. Finally bibtex-yank will put the entry in the new file we select. We should try not to add entries if there is already a key present in the file.

A subtlety is the function should not take an argument, so it can work in our cite menu, but it needs an interactive file selection to say where the entry is copied to.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

We might also want to copy a short summary to the clipboard, so we could readily paste it somewhere. Here is one way to do it. You might prefer (bibtex-copy-summary-as-kill) instead.

They seem to work! These are built in to org-ref now, so if you update to the latest version they should work for you too.

The next step is to use this to update an entry. Presumably ASAP articles will have their metadata updated in the future. It would be great to be able to run a command on an entry and update it. To do that, we need a convenient function to set a bibtex field. There is a function to get a field, but not to set a field. This next block is the closest thing I have come up with that sets a field

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun bibtex-set-field (field value)
  "set field to value in bibtex file. create field if it does not exist"
  (interactive "sfield: \nsvalue: ")

	;; we found a field
	(progn
	  (goto-char (car (cdr found)))
	  (when value
	    (bibtex-kill-field)
	    (bibtex-make-field field)
	    (backward-char)
	    (insert value)))
      ;; make a new field

Now, we want a function to update a bibtex entry. The function will get the doi from the entry, then retrieve the json data, and then update each field. We need to get the keys in the json results, and then map each key to a field in a bibtex entry. Here we go.

I have had a need lately to convert Endnote libraries into bibtex files. Endnote has a BibTeX-Export style that will export your library. One issue with that style is it expects you to have a label in each entry. If you are a normal Endnote user, you do not have labels on any entry. There is no need for them. I also found that for entries with no label, there is no comma in the entry header, which causes Emacs to think the entry is syntactically incorrect. I fixed up the style to prevent that from happening. You can get a copy of the style [[C:\Users\jkitchin\Documents\EndNote\Styles\BibTeX-Export-kitchin.ens][here]].

Now, if you load that style, you can export a library to a
file. Endnote insists on making it a text file. We need to rename the
file, then we need to create keys for each entry. Normally, I would do
that with =bibtex-clean-entry=, which mostly works by hand. However, the bibtex entries are not correct yet, because they have no keys. We will add simple numeric keys, and then map over each entry to add proper keys.

First, we need to take an author string, and parse it into a list of cons cells containing first and last names. Authors are separated by "and" in bibtex. The names are either "Lastname, Firstname" or "First Name LastName". For now, we do not handle von names.

Now, when I save this file, I am prompted for a commit message, then I press C-c C-c to commit it.

If we make a new file: file:new-file.org I do not get quite what I would have expected. The file is added, but not committed. The second save prompts for a commit message.

So, what should happen? I think you should only be prompted for a commit message when you want one. I often save to avoid losing work, but I wouldn't always want to write a commit message for that. Also, if the file is new, I want it added /and/ committed. Probably, you should commit when a buffer is killed.

It turns out there are a lot of helpful vc commands built into Emacs.

This doesn't exactly work. I gather it is supposed to switch modes by detecting if you are between two markers.

this example is broken

I modified this a little. It seems switching back and forth between org-mode is annoying, the buffer tends to get folded.

Help on ModuleWrapper in module jedi.evaluate.representation object:

class ModuleWrapper(jedi._compatibility.HackClass)
 |  The top scope, which is always a module.
 |  Depending on the underlying parser this may be a full module or just a part
 |  of a module.
 |
 |  Method resolution order:
 |      ModuleWrapper
 |      jedi._compatibility.HackClass
 |      jedi.parser.tree.Module
 |      jedi.parser.tree.Scope
 |      jedi.parser.tree.BaseNode
 |      Wrapper
 |      jedi.parser.tree.Base
 |      jedi.parser.tree.DocstringMixin
 |      builtins.object
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __getattr__(self, name)
 |
 |  __init__(self, evaluator, module)
 |      Initialize :class:`Module`.
 |
 |      :type path: str
 |      :arg  path: File path to this module.
 |
 |      .. todo:: Document `top_module`.
 |
 |  __repr__(self)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |
 |  names_dicts(self, search_global)
 |
 |  py__file__(self)
 |      In contrast to Python's __file__ can be None.
 |
 |  py__name__(self)
 |
 |  py__package__(self)
 |
 |  star_imports = wrapper(obj, *args, **kwargs)
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors defined here:
 |
 |  name
 |
 |  py__path__
 |      Not seen here, since it's a property. The callback actually uses a
 |      variable, so use it like::
 |
 |          foo.py__path__(sys_path)
 |
 |      In case of a package, this returns Python's __path__ attribute, which
 |      is a list of paths (strings).
 |      Raises an AttributeError if the module is not a package.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors inherited from jedi._compatibility.HackClass:
 |
 |  __dict__
 |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
 |
 |  __weakref__
 |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors inherited from jedi.parser.tree.Module:
 |
 |  error_statement_stacks
 |
 |  global_names
 |
 |  has_explicit_absolute_import
 |      Checks if imports in this module are explicitly absolute, i.e. there
 |      is a ``__future__`` import.
 |
 |  path
 |
 |  used_names
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data and other attributes inherited from jedi.parser.tree.Module:
 |
 |  type = 'file_input'

 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Methods inherited from jedi.parser.tree.Scope:
 |
 |  is_scope(self)
 |
 |  walk(self)
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Data descriptors inherited from jedi.parser.tree.Scope:
 |
 |  flows
 |
 |  imports
 |
 |  names_dict
 |
 |  returns
 |
 |  statements
 |
 |  subscopes
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Methods inherited from jedi.parser.tree.BaseNode:
 |
 |  first_leaf(self)
 |
 |  get_code(self)
 |
 |  get_statement_for_position lambda *args, **kwargs
 |
 |  move(self, line_offset, column_offset)

 |  Methods inherited from Wrapper:
 |
 |  is_class(self)
 |
 |  py__bool__(self)
 |      Since Wrapper is a super class for classes, functions and modules,
 |      the return value will always be true.
 |
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Methods inherited from jedi.parser.tree.Base:
 |
 |  get_parent_scope(self, include_flows=False)
 |      Returns the underlying scope.

 |
 |  isinstance(self, *cls)

Here are some example code blocks.

It looks like for this to work, you need use a function the server can evaluate, and the function has to have a name the server knows. There needs to be a userID stored in a variable for this. The org src-block needs a name that is the problemID.

It might be nice to show model solutions and pep8 style feedback. I can get the hints, but I am not sure about submitting this.

For engineering, if we can use Enthought or Continuum we can get numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. I would also want some other packages installed. Synchronization between local installations and the server could be a challenge.

Some reference managers like Zotero, Mendeley and Endnote can take a pdf and build a reference entry from it. There is a python project here: https://github.com/venthur/gscholar/blob/master/gscholar/gscholar.py that builds a google scholar query to get bibtex entries. We will build on this here, using emacs-lisp. The first step we need is to build the query. In gscholar.py they use [[http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html][pdftotext]] to get the pdf text and then select 20 words. The first 20 don't seem like the right choice to me since many pdfs have cover pages with nothing of substance on them. A really sophisticated tool would try to find the most relevant text, e.g. something that is clearly a title or doi, but there is so little structure in pdfs across the literature this does not seem worthwhile right now. So, we will take the last 20 words from the second page.

;; * gscholar bibtex

;;   Retrieve BibTeX entries from Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore
;;   and DBLP by your query. All in Emacs Lisp!

;;   *UPDATE*: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and DBLP are now supported though
;;    the package name doesn't suggest that.
;; ** Basic usage
;;    Without package.el:
;;        (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gscholar-bibtex.el")
;;        (require 'gscholar-bibtex)

;;    With package.el: install via melpa!

;;    To use, simply call
;;         M-x gscholar-bibtex

;;   Choose a source, then enter your query and select the results.

;;   Available commands in `gscholar-bibtex-mode', i.e., in the window of search
;;   results:
;;   - n/p: next/previous
;;   - TAB: show BibTeX entry for current search result
;;   - A/W: append/write to `gscholar-bibtex-database-file' (see later)
;;   - a/w: append/write to a file
;;   - c: close BibTeX entry window
;;   - q: quit

;; ** Sources
;;   By default, I enable all sources(Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, IEEE
;;   Xplore and DBLP). If you don't want to enable some of them, you could call
;;       M-x gscholar-bibtex-turn-off-sources

;;   Similarly, if you want to enable some of them, you could call
;;       M-x gscholar-bibtex-turn-on-sources

;;   To keep the configuration in your init file, you could use the following
;;   format(*NOT* real code):
;;       (gscholar-bibtex-source-on-off action source-name)

;;   Possible values:
;;   - action: :on or :off
;;   - source-name: "Google Scholar", "ACM Digital Library" or "IEEE Xplore"

;;   Say if you want to disable "IEEE Xplore", use the following code:
;;       (gscholar-bibtex-source-on-off :off "IEEE Xplore")

;; ** Default source
;;   If you have a preferred source, you can set it as default so you don't have to
;;   type the name to select the source every time you call `gscholar-bibtex'. Say
;;   if you want to set "Google Scholar" as default:
;;       (setq gscholar-bibtex-default-source "Google Scholar")

;;   Note that in order to make it work, you have to make sure the source name is
;;   correct and you don't disable the source that you set as default, otherwise
;;   the default source setting has no effect. Besides, if you only have one source
;;   enabled, then the enabled source automatically becomes the default, regardless
;;   of the value of `gscholar-bibtex-default-source'.

;; ** Configuring `gscholar-bibtex-database-file'
;;    If you have a master BibTeX file, say refs.bib, as database, and want to
;;    append/write the BibTeX entry to refs.bib without being asked for a
;;    filename to be written every time, you can set
;;    `gscholar-bibtex-database-file':
;;        (setq gscholar-bibtex-database-file "/path/to/refs.bib")

;;    Then use "A" or "W" to append or write to refs.bib, respectively.

;; ** Adding more sources
;;    Currently these three sources cover nearly all my needs, and it is possible
;;    if you need to add more sources.

;;    Basically, you need to implement following five functions(if you're willing,
;;    I think looking the source code is better. The implementation is easy!):
;; #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; (defun gscholar-bibtex-SourceName-search-results (query)
;; "In the body, call `gscholar-bibtex--url-retrieve-as-string' to return a string

This sort of worked. I got blocked from google at one point, and I found it difficult to figure out how to get the bibtex entries from the code above (although it does do it). My doi-utils package seems better.








* A highlight annotation mode with overlays :ARCHIVE:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       092E2F6F-B824-4FF3-9429-D3704AEF7B59
  :END:
One of my students asked about highlighting text in emacs for note-taking. For temporary use, this is pretty easy, you put an overlay on a region that modifies the face, and any other properties you choose. One downside of overlays, as opposed to font-lock properties, is they do not "follow" text when you cut and paste them. On the other hand, they are easier to work with. So, we will work through doing this with overlays, and another day try it out with font-lock properties.

Here is a simple function to put a highlight on a region.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ov)

(defun highlight-region (beg end)
 (interactive "r")
 (ov beg end 'face '(:background "Light Salmon") 'help-echo "highlighted" 'highlighted t))

(global-set-key (kbd "s-h") 'highlight-region)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight-region

The trouble is these are temporary, and disappear when you close the file. So, we need to save them. It is easy to get the overlays in the buffer, and we only want ones that have the 'highlighted property. So we just get those, and then save the information we need to recreate them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ov-in 'highlighted t)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| #<overlay from 1041 to 1062 in blog.org> | #<overlay from 536 to 552 in blog.org> |

Here is the code we use to save the overlay data in an external file. We use a hidden dotfile for this so we don't clutter our directory up. Then, we will save the start, end and properties of each overlay so we can reconstruct them later. We add this to a save hook, so it updates our file each time we save the buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun highlight-save-filename ()
  "Return name of file to save overlays in."
  (concat "." (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)) ".highlights"))

(defun highlight-save ()
  "Save highlight overlays in an external file"
  (interactive)
  (when (buffer-file-name)
    (save-buffer)
    (let ((fname (highlight-save-filename))
	  (ovs (ov-in 'highlighted t)))
      (if ovs
	  (with-temp-file fname
	    (prin1
	     (mapcar
	      (lambda (ov)
		(list (overlay-start ov)
		      (overlay-end ov)
		      (overlay-properties ov)))
	      ovs)
	     (current-buffer)))
	;; Delete file if no ovs
	(and (file-exists-p fname)
	     (delete-file fname))))))

(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'highlight-save)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight-save

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(highlight-save)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 1041 | 1062 | (highlighted t help-echo highlighted face (:background Light Salmon)) |
|  536 |  552 | (highlighted t help-echo highlighted face (:background Light Salmon)) |

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cat .blog.org.highlights
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((4288 4296 (highlighted t help-echo "Some note to yourself about the tip" face (:background "Yellow1"))) (4184 4188 (highlighted t help-echo "highlighted" face (:background "Darkolivegreen1"))) (4178 4182 (highlighted t help-echo "highlighted" face (:background "Coral"))) (3496 3508 (highlighted t help-echo "highlighted" face (:background "Light Salmon"))) (1041 1062 (highlighted t help-echo "highlighted" face (:background "Light Salmon"))) (536 552 (highlighted t help-echo "highlighted" face (:background "Light Salmon"))))


Now, we also need to be able to load the overlays. We set this in a hook too, so the overlays get created when we open the file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun highlight-load ()
  "Load and apply overlays"
  (interactive)
  (let ((fname (highlight-save-filename)))
    (when (file-exists-p fname)
      (mapc
       (lambda (entry)
	 (ov (nth 0 entry)		; beg
	     (nth 1 entry)		; end
	     (nth 2 entry)))		; properties

      (with-temp-buffer
	(insert-file-contents fname)
	(read (current-buffer)))))))

(add-hook 'find-file-hook 'highlight-load)
#+END_SRC

So far so good. Let's raise the bar on ridiculosity and use helm-colors to select the highlight color. You will be able to highlight  with crazy color resolution. We will up the ante and also allow this function to update an existing highlight.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun highlight (beg end &optional color)
  "Put a highlight overlay on the region. If on an overlay, change the color"
  (interactive "r")
  (unless color
    (setq color (s-trim (helm-colors))))
  (if (ov-at)
      (ov-set (ov-at) 'face `(:background ,color))
    (unless (region-active-p)
      (error "No region selected."))
    (ov beg end 'face `(:background ,color) 'help-echo "highlighted" 'highlighted t)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight

What  else can we do? Let's make a special highlight note where you can put your own text as a tooltip, and a function to edit the text.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun highlight-note (beg end &optional color note)
  (interactive "r")
  (unless (region-active-p)
    (error "No region selected."))
  (unless color
    (setq color (s-trim (helm-colors))))
  (unless note
    (setq note (read-input "Note: ")))
  (ov beg end 'face `(:background ,color) 'help-echo note 'highlighted t))

;; We need to edit a note too
(defun highlight-note-edit (new-note)
  (interactive (list (read-input "New note: " (overlay-get (ov-at) 'help-echo))))
  (ov-set (ov-at) 'help-echo new-note))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight-note-edit

After a while you may want to list your notes. This function is a little clumsy in window management. Basically we make a new buffer with the highlighted text and a link to get back to it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun highlight-list ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((ovs (ov-in 'highlighted t))
	 (cb (current-buffer))
	 (links (mapcar
		 (lambda (ov)
		   (format "[[%s][link]]%s\n"
			   (format
			    "elisp:(progn (switch-to-buffer \"%s\")(goto-char %s))"
			    cb (overlay-start ov))
			   (buffer-substring
			    (overlay-start ov)
			    (overlay-end ov))))
		 ovs)))
    (split-window-right)
    (switch-to-buffer-other-window "*highlights*") (erase-buffer)
    (org-mode)
    (mapc
     (lambda (s)
       (insert s))
     links)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight-list

At some point you will want to clear all your highlights. After you do this, if you save the buffer, they will be gone forever.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun highlight-clear ()
  (interactive)
  (ov-clear 'highlighted t)
  (when (get-buffer "*highlights*") (kill-buffer "*highlights*")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight-clear


Finally, a few convenience functions and a menu. We define some standard highlight colors for convenience, an menu in the "Org" menu, a hydra, and a final key binding to the hydra.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun highlight-yellow ()
  (interactive)

   ["Highlight (P)" highlight-pink]
   ["Highlight (Y)" highlight-yellow]
   ["List highlights" highlight-list]
   ["Clear highlights" highlight-clear])
 "Show/Hide")

(defhydra highlight (:color blue) "highlighter"
  ("b" highlight-blue "blue")
  ("g" highlight-green "Green")
  ("p" highlight-pink "Pink")
  ("s" (highlight (region-beginning) (region-end) "Lightsalmon1") "Salmon")
  ("y" highlight-yellow "yellow")

  ("N" highlight-note "Note")
  ("m" highlight-mouse-on "Mouse highlight")
  ("M" highlight-mouse-off "Mouse off")
  ("e" highlight-note-edit "Edit note")
  ("l" highlight-list "List highlights")
  ("r" highlight-load "Reload")
  ("s" highlight-save "Save")
  ("C" highlight-clear "Clear"))

(global-set-key (kbd "s-h") 'highlight/body)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: highlight/body

There  are some limitations here. Overlays are not attached to text, so you cannot cut and paste them. Boo... You have to use the hook functions to keep the external file synchronized with the buffer. If these ever get out of sync, good luck resynchronizing them.

 - The war was you and me : civilians in the American Civil War. Cashin, Joan E.
  Though civilians constituted the majority of the nation's population and were intimately involved with almost every aspect of the war, we know little about the civilian experience of the Civil War. Southerners lived through the breakup of basic social and economic institutions, including slavery. Northerners witnessed the reorganization of society to fight the war. And citizens of the border regions grappled with elemental questions of loyalty that reached into the family itself. These original essays recover the stories of civilians from Natchez to New England. They address the experiences of men, women, and children of whites, slaves, and free blacks and of civilians from numerous classes. Not least of these stories are the on-the-ground experiences of slaves seeking emancipation and the actions of white Northerners who resisted the draft. Many of the authors present brand new material, such as the war's effect on the sounds of daily life and on reading culture. Others examine the war's premiere events, including the battle of Gettysburg and the Lincoln assassination, from fresh perspectives. Several consider the passionate debate that broke out over how to remember the war, a debate that has persisted into our own time.

* Looking up chemicals by CAS number
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       8F4E3661-B2F2-45AB-AA8D-3509516D5EC7
  :END:

Benzene has a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_Registry_Number][CAS]] number of 71-43-2. That number can be used to retrieve information about benzene, e.g.

http://www.commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=71-43-2

Aldrich: http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/search?term=71-43-2&interface=CAS%20No.&N=0&mode=partialmax

What? Of course that looks like an opportunity for an org-link ;) Here is a bare bones link to open a website and export to html.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-add-link-type
 "cas"
 (lambda (cas-number)
   (browse-url
    (format "http://www.commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=%s" cas-number)))
 (lambda (cas-number desc backend)
   (format "<a href=\"http://www.commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=%s\">CAS:%s</a>" cas-number (or desc cas-number))))
#+END_SRC

And here is the link in action: cas:71-43-2. The link syntax is pretty rigid (but has the advantage of exporting in a fixed format), and you might prefer some flexibility, say CAS: 71-43-2 or CAS 71-43-2. Maybe because you want to apply this to text that is not org-mode formatted. button-lock to the rescue (again).

We can build a regexp that defines a CAS number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAS_Registry_Number), and use it to make clickable text. A wrinkle on past examples here is we need a regexp that provides some context around the number, but ultimately we want to extract a piece of the regexp (the number). We do this by saving the regexp as a variable so that we can match to it later. We use a lot of shy groups in the regexp and explicitly number the group we want. We will make the clickable text open a website to the search results on the CAS number.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq cas-re  "\\(?:CAS\\|cas\\)\\(?::?\\)\\s-*\\(?1:[0-9]\\{2,7\\}-[0-9]\\{2\\}-[0-9]\\)")

 (lambda ()
   (interactive)
   (save-match-data
     (let ((s  (let ((result (button-lock-find-extent (point))))

       (string-match cas-re s)
       (browse-url
	(format
	 "http://www.commonchemistry.org/ChemicalDetail.aspx?ref=%s"
	 (match-string 1 s))))))
 :face '((:underline t))
 :help-echo "A Chemical Abstracts Service number. Click to search"
 :additional-property 'cas)
#+END_SRC

This is an example where we use some context to identify the relevant text to make functional (e.g. 71-43-2 by itself is not highlighted).

The last little idea is to create an idle timer to launch the build whenever we are idle. There are some tricks we want to use. First, we need to save the timer so we can cancel it later. Second, we need two timers, one to start the build, and one to check when it is done.

* Writing emacs-lisp code with lentic

  :END:
org-mode provides a way to do literate programming where you can intermingle code and narrative text. The code can be "tangled" out to the real executable code file. I mostly love this capability, and have used it to write several packages in [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][jkitchin/org-ref]]. There are some things that are tricky though. I find I have to manage carefully which blocks get tangled explicitly because different setups might have different default tangle behavior. This does allow me to intermingle code, example usage, and even tests in one document.  After it has been tangled, all the narrative text is gone, and separated from what I consider to be the "source". Not everyone is fluent in using org to automatically load code from an org file. Finally, it is not currently possible to distribute org-ref through MELPA or to include it in org because the code is in org-format. I could have some kind of release tool, perhaps a Makefile that tangles the file to make an elisp file, and ideally run some tests on it. I want to avoid this redirection, and keep the source as close to what I use as possible, ideally the same as what I use.

Here we consider [[https://github.com/phillord/lentic][phillord/lentic]], which is an alternative point of view to literate programming. In lentic, you have a source file that is in its native language, e.g. emacs-lisp, but you can create a view of the file as if it was an org-mode file. You can edit either view, and both views are automatically updated in the proper format, i.e. narrative text in org appears as comments in emacs-lisp, and code in emacs-lisp appears in a source block in org. There is only one permanent file, and the views exist temporarily.

Is this useful? The code in the end is functionally equivalent, and a user would never know the difference. It is useful then, if it helps the author write better code, or a maintainer to maintain it. Being both of those for some packages, hopefully this will be useful!

So, lentic works by having some minor markup in the emacs-lisp code that enables it to transform the elisp to an org-file. For example consider this example from the lentic package:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;;; orgel-org.el --- A test file -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;; Author: Phillip Lord

;;; Commentary:

;; This is an "orgel" file. That is a valid emacs lisp file with comments in
;; org-mode. The header comments are translated into header one in org mode.


;; #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun orgel-function ())
;; #+END_SRC

;; And we finish off with the local variables declaration.

;; # Local Variables:
;; # lentic-init: lentic-orgel-org-init
;; # End:
#+END_SRC

There is mostly the usual header section, but the code is wrapped in comments that resemble the org-mode code-block. There is also a local variable that is defined when the file is opened. There is a small amount of boiler-plate stuff here, namely the top line and the local variables. I should note that lentic provides a function to insert the local variables for you, and it is bound to "C-c , f", and it even has completion. It is important that the lentic-init variable be defined before you can create a lentic view. This makes for a minor dilemma in starting a new file you want to edit with lentic. When you first create the file you need to create the file and either manually set this variable, or open it and close it. You need this file because it might be possible you prefer a LaTeX file instead of an org-file, or in the future perhaps some other kind of markup like markdown, etc... Maybe the file wouldn't even be emacs-lisp, it could be clojure, or one might hope Python in the future.

Anyway, this brings me to the point of this post, which is to write a little function that generates this boilerplate stuff and creates a lentic view for a new file, or that opens an existing file in my preferred view.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun lentic-open-orgel (base-name)
 "Create a new lentic el file if base-name.el does not exist, or open it if it does.
Create a lentic view with org-file on the right."
 (interactive "sBase name (no extension): ")
 (delete-other-windows)
 (unless (file-exists-p (concat base-name ".el"))
   (with-temp-file (concat base-name ".el")
     (insert
      (format ";;; %s.el ---    -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Header:

;;; Commentary:

;;; Reminders about lentic:
;; Lentic key binding reminders
;; C-c , h  Move here in other view
;; C-c , s  Swap windows
;; [[elisp:lentic-mode-split-window-right]]  C-c o to open this link and make the view

;;; Code:

;;; %s.el ends here

;; # Local Variables:
;; # lentic-init: lentic-orgel-org-init
;; # End:" base-name base-name))))
 (find-file (concat base-name ".el"))
 (lentic-mode-split-window-right))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
: lentic-open-orgel

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(lentic-open-orgel "test-orgel")
#+END_SRC

Time will tell if I use this often. Maybe there are other simpler ways to do this that bypass the local variables. The lentic source uses a directory variable, but that is nearly the same except that it might have less impact on the distributed code. In any case, I really like this idea.

  :END:

You have probably wondered why some words are colored in Emacs and wondered how some text behaves like a link. That happens from font locking. Here we look at some ways you can modify this behavior too.

Following and lightly adapting the example here [[info:emacs#Font%20Lock][info:emacs#Font Lock]], we can add some keywords that get highlighted for us like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(font-lock-add-keywords
 nil  ;; mode, nil for current buffer
 '(("FIXME"  ; regexp with group you want to match
    'font-lock-warning-face	; the face to use
)))
#+END_SRC

FIXME some text. FIXME again. It works!

How do you know what faces are available? M-x list-faces-display will give you a nice buffer of face names you can choose from. Let's do one better though, and create our own face.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defface my-face
  '((t		; display type
     (:background "yellow" :foreground "black")))
     "My custom face.")

(font-lock-add-keywords
 'org-mode  ;; mode, nil for current buffer
 '(("BROKEN"  ; regexp with group you want to match
    0
    'my-face	; the face to use

* Getting messages about the link under the mouse cursor
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       E027BD25-A05C-4A0A-9947-62D5620A9D63
  :END:
Now that I have set up org-ref to give minibuffer messages when the cursor is on a link, I thought, why can't this happen when I mouse over a link. I am likely to just mouse over links while reading them, and not necessarily have the cursor moving. Well, here is the idea. We can get the mouse position, which is approximately the number of lines from the top of the frame, and a number of characters from the beginning of a line. A trick is that there may not be a character at that position, if the line is shorter than those characters. So, we will have to calculate from the mouse position whether there is a character where the mouse is.

Another trick is we don't want to remessage our selves constantly, so we will store the last mouse position, and not do anything unless it changes.

An idle timer does not do what we want here. Apparently, idle refers to the cursor, not the mouse. I use a regular timer here, and run it every 1/2 second. I don't notice any performance issues with this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
efvar org-ref-last-mouse-pos nil

  "See if a character is under the mouse. If so return the position for `goto-char'."

    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (window-start))
      (forward-line line)
      (if
	  (> (- (line-end-position) (line-beginning-position)) col)

	nil))))

* Helm source for headings with TODO
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       673E4099-85C2-4710-846A-A50AD5D649D5
  :END:


For a helm source we need a list of cons cells that have a car of a selection, and a cdr that corresponds to that selection.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
(defun helm-todo-candidates ()
  (let ((results '()))
    (org-map-entries
     (lambda ()
       (add-to-list 'results
		    (cons
		     (concat (make-string (nth 1 (org-heading-components)) ?*)
			     " TODO "
			     (nth 4 (org-heading-components)))
		     (point-marker))))
     "TODO=\"TODO\"")
    results))

(helm-todo-candidates)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
((** post it . #<marker at 977 in blog.org>) (** work it out . #<marker at 941 in blog.org>))

Now to run helm, there is a subtle point. We need to map the current buffer /before/ running helm, otherwise we will map an empty helm buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun helm-todo ()
  "Helm interface to headlines with TODO status in current buffer."
  (interactive)
  (let ((candidates (helm-todo-candidates)))
    (setq helm-todo-source '((name . "TODO headlines")
			     (candidates . candidates)
			     (action . (("open" . goto-char)))))
    (helm :sources '(helm-todo-source))))

(helm-todo)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now, let us expand the idea to a helm-agenda. We want a function that prompts for a match criteria, then presents a helm buffer to select matching entries in your agenda files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun helm-agenda-candidates (query)
  (let ((results '()))
    (mapc (lambda (f)
      (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect f)
	(org-map-entries
	 (lambda ()
	   (add-to-list 'results

			 (concat
			  (file-name-nondirectory f) " | "
			  (make-string (nth 1 (org-heading-components)) ?*)
			  " "
			  (org-get-heading))
			 (point-marker))))
	 query))) (org-agenda-files))
    results))


(defun helm-query-agenda (query)
  "Helm interface to headlines with TODO status in current buffer."
  (interactive "sQuery: ")
  (let ((candidates (helm-agenda-candidates query)))
    (helm :sources '(((name . "TODO headlines")

* Filtering an org-mode table
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       1D966382-F050-4070-9CB7-B03A2B0D3BDF
  :END:

Suppose I have this table, and I want to filter it for all entries having a topic of 1. Of course you can sort the table by topic and find the group. I want something like Excel has where you filter and make the other rows disappear.

First, let's take a look at some org-table functions that will be useful. Let us assume our filtering command is run interactively in a table. We need to know what column we are in, which we can get with =org-table-current-column=. We then might go to the beginning of the table. WE can find that with =org-table-begin=. Then, we iterate through the rows with =org-table-next-row=, and check the value of a field in the desired column with =org-table-get-field=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun filter-message ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((current-column (org-table-current-column))
	 (current-value (org-table-get-field))
	 (filtered-lines  '()))
    (goto-char (org-table-begin))
    ;(message-box "%s" (org-table-current-dline))
    (while (org-table-p)
      (forward-line)
      (message "%s" (org-table-get-field current-column))
      (if (not
	   (string= current-value (org-table-get-field current-column)))
	  (add-to-list 'filtered-lines nil)
	(add-to-list 'filtered-lines t)))
    (message-box "%s" filtered-lines    )
    ))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: filter-message




maybe see https://gist.github.com/doitian/1571162 for a folding way

* A new data structure for me in emacs-lisp
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       683D257C-3A5A-446D-A179-7E7D5E0592BB
  :END:

I am examining the struct data type in emacs-lisp today. This creates something like an object with fields of data that are accessed by name. We will create a student object that contains first name, last name and an email address.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defstruct student first-name last-name email)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: student

Let us make a student now, and assign it to a variable.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq s1
      (make-student :first-name "John"
		    :last-name "Kitchin"
		    :email "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [cl-struct-student "John" "Kitchin" "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"]

The defstruct macro automatically creates accessor functions with names of NAME-SLOT. NAME in this case is student, and SLOT is one of the words we defined in the defstruct call. We access data from the student like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(list
 (student-first-name s1)
 (student-last-name s1)
 (student-email s1))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| John | Kitchin | jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu |

Now, let us print the object.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(princ s1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [cl-struct-student "John" "Kitchin" "jkitchin@andrew.cmu.edu"]

We can use generalized setf to change the values in the object.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setf (student-email s1) "jkitchin@cmu.edu")
(princ s1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [cl-struct-student "John" "Kitchin" "jkitchin@cmu.edu"]

Finally, the defstruct macro also defines a function to test if a variable is one of these objects. We can confirm a variable is a student object like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(student-p s1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t

This looks like a relatively handy way to encapsulate data in emacs-lisp, and accessing the data seems more readable than using any combination of car, cdr, elt and nth.

;;; Commentary:

;; This helm source can be used to look up words in local (offline)
;; dictionaries.  It also provides short-cuts for various online
;; dictionaries, which is useful in situations where the local
;; dictionary doesn't have an entry for a word.
;;
;; Dictionaries are available for a variety of language pairs.  See
;; the project page for an incomplete list:
;;
;;     https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm-dictionary

;;; Install:

;; Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add the following in
;; your Emacs startup file:
;;
;;     (require 'helm-dictionary)
;;
;; Alternatively, you can use autoload:
;;
;;     (autoload 'helm-dictionary "helm-dictionary" "" t)
;;
;; In order to specify a dictionary set the variable
;; `helm-dictionary-database' to the filename of that dictionary.
;;
;; A dictionary for German and English can be found in the Debian
;; package trans-de-en.  This package is also available in many
;; distributions derived from Debian such as Ubuntu.  Alternatively,
;; this dictionary can also be downloaded here:
;;
;;   http://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/
;;
;; A dictionary for German and Spanish can be found here:
;;
;;   https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/ding-es-de
;;
;; A variety of dictionaries with English as the source or target
;; language can be found here:
;;
;;   https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:Matthias_Buchmeier
;;
;; These dictionaries were automatically created from the Wiktionary
;; database.  Their size and quality may vary.  Also generated from
;; Wiktionary are the following dictionaries with Russian as the
;; source or target language:
;;
;;   http://wiktionary-export.nataraj.su/en/
;;
;; If the local dictionary doesn't have an entry for a word, it can be
;; useful to try online dictionaries available on the

;; for looking up the currently entered string in these online
;; dictionaries.  The variable `helm-dictionary-online-dicts'
;; specifies which online dictionaries should be listed.  The value of
;; that variable is a list conses.  The first element of each cons
;; specifies the name of an online dictionary for display during
;; searches.  The second element is the URL used for retrieving search
;; results from the respective dictionary.  This URL has to contain a
;; "%s" at the position where the search term should be inserted.
;;

;; The browser specified in `helm-dictionary-browser-function' will be
;; used to show results from online dictionaries.  If this variable is
;; nil (default), the value of the variable
;; `browse-url-browser-function' will be used (the currently
;; configured Emacs-wide default browser).  If that variable is also
;; nil, helm uses the first available browser in
;; `helm-browse-url-default-browser-alist'.

;;; Usage:

;; Use the command `helm-dictionary' to start a new search.  As usual,
;; a search is case-insensitive unless the expression contains capital
;; letters.  Regular expressions can also be used as search
;; terms.  During a search, you can use `M-n` to search for the word
;; at which you called `helm-dictionary`.

;; There are two actions available: insert the currently selected term
;; in the source language (left) or in the target language (right) at
;; point, i.e., the cursor position at which `helm-dictionary' was
;; called.

;; In the section "Look up online", you can choose among several online
;; dictionaries.  If you select one of the entries listed in this
;; section, a browser will be used to display search results from the
;; respective dictionary.

* make any org link a menu link
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       9890E268-29DD-4E39-AE7E-E0A4278ECDDB
  :END:

It seems like it should be possible to make org links have variable behavior. For example, if one action is defined, it should be done. If more than one action is defined, you should get a menu. One way to achieve this is to hijack the org-link functions, or in cases where lambda functions are used, we have to redefine them. The follow functions are defined in org-link-protocols.

It finds two spelling errors, and a probable other kind of error (whether/weather), and a grammar issue. It would be nice to parse this into something more helpful. Emacs has come xml parsing [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/XmlParserExamples][capabilities]], which we consider next.

Basically, you post a request to the website, and you get an xml response back. I adapted this code from https://bitbucket.org/miguelventura/after_the_deadline/wiki/Home to do a simple spell check. The idea is to build this up to an emacs lisp library that does this from a command.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

import urllib

payload = urllib.urlencode({'key': None,
                            'data': 'I spel gud'})

url = "http://service.afterthedeadline.com/checkDocument"

r = requests.post(url, data=payload)

from xml.etree import ElementTree
e = ElementTree.fromstring(r.text)

errs = e.findall('message')
if len(errs) > 0:
    raise Exception('Server returned an error: %s' % errs[0].text)

for err in e.findall('error'):
    if err[1].text == 'Spelling':
        print '\n**{}** mispelled\nSuggestions:'.format(err[0].text)

I have written about filters before, but admittedly, I have never fully grasped how to get all the information you need. For example, in [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/09/28/Changing-links-to-files-so-they-work-in-a-blog/][this post]] I came up with a convoluted method to preprocess an org-file to get a list of link properties, and then keep a running counter to access the nth property. Recently I saw this [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2014-10/msg00084.html][post]] on the org-mode mail list that made me think I have totally missed the boat on how to do this!

Here is the key point I have missed all along. You can apparently get the element associated with the text, and from that you can get any property of the element. Apparently, you find the next property change, and then get them. The element is stored sometimes as a text property.

* Scripting git
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       C365D05B-368B-4BC9-9436-DA4548164D4B
  :END:
I am running a project where I need to script git to "do the right thing" non-interactively. The project involves students creating assignments, and then turning them in. They create the assignments in Emacs+org-mode, and then "turn in" the assignment by running a menu command that commits their work to a git repository, and then pushes it to my server. Some emacs-lisp code does all this magic. Most of the time.

Occasionally, students have had trouble when it comes time to update their graded assignments. These assignments have been pulled from the server by me, graded, and pushed back. I did not anticipate that students would continue changing their local repos after turning the work in, and this causes issues when they try to pull the results back.

Here I document how to make this process a bit more robust. Basically, we need to make sure the local repo is clean before we pull, then we need to check if there were merge conflicts. Since the conflicts are probably notes the students took, we will be conservative and just accept the merge markers in the text so they do not lose their notes.

What we need to do is check the output of "git status --porcelain" and do an appropriate action for each file. The output of this command is one line per file that requires some action. Basically we can have untracked files, which should just be added and committed. The reason for this is that if I create a file with the same name, it will be a conflict for git to overwrite their existing file. There could be added or modified files, renamed files, deleted files  updated but unmerged, and some other possibilities too.

The "git status --porcelain" command gives a two letter status code for each file that is not "clean". The first letter is the status of the index, and the second letter is the status of the work-tree, unless there is a merge conflict, and then they are the status of the file on each side of the merge.

#+RESULTS:

It seems like we need to parse the porcelain command, get X, and Y, and depending on what those are, we have a set of cond statements to act appropriately.


Here is a function to parse a line of porcelain output.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :dir ~/Desktop/A :results raw
(defun parse-line (line)
  (let* ((X (substring line 0 1))
	 (Y (substring line 1 2))
	 (PATHS (split-string (substring line 3)))
	 (PATH1 (nth 0 PATHS))
         ; for a rename there will be PATH1 -> PATH2
	 (PATH2 (if (= 3 (length PATHS)) (nth 2 PATHS) nil)))
    (list X Y PATH1 PATH2 line)))

(defun parse-git-status ()
 (interactive)
(loop for line in (split-string
		  (shell-command-to-string "git status --porcelain") "\n")
      when (not (string= "" line)) collect (parse-line line)))
#+END_SRC

Now we check out the results.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :dir ~/Desktop/A
(parse-git-status)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| R |   | f1       | f1-rname | R  f1 -> f1-rname |
|   | D | f2       | nil      | D f2              |
| ? | ? | f2-rname | nil      | ?? f2-rname       |

That function gives us a list of X, Y, FROM, and TO, and the original string.

Now, we can start building the logic to handle these. The goal of this block as after running, the repo is clean, and you can then pull into it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :dir ~/Desktop/A :results output
(let ((merge-p nil))
  (loop for (X Y FROM TO LINE) in (parse-git-status)
	do
	(cond
	 ;; untracked files get added and committed.
	 ((and (string= X "?")
	       (string= Y "?"))
	  (shell-command (format "git add %s" FROM))
	  (shell-command
	   (format "git commit %s \"adding %s.\""
		   FROM FROM)))

	 ;; user rename
	 ((and (string= X "R")
	       (string= Y " "))
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m \"rename %s to %s\"" FROM FROM TO)))

	 ;; rename and modify
	 ((and (string= X "R")
	       (string= Y "M"))
	  ;; commit the rename
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m \"rename %s to %s\"" FROM FROM TO))
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m \"changes in %s\"" TO TO)))

	 ;; added file
	 ((and (string= X "A")
	       (string= Y " "))
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m  \"Adding %s\"" FROM FROM)))

	 ;; deleted file
	 ((and (string= X " ")
	       (string= Y "D"))
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m \"Deleting %s\"" FROM FROM)))

	 ;; modified file
	 ((or (string= X "M")
	      (string= Y "M"))
          (shell-command (format "git add %s" FROM))
	  (shell-command (format "git commit %s -m \"changes in %s\"" FROM FROM)))

	 ;; merge conflict, we just add the file
	 ;; we do not commit here because you cannot partially commit.
	 ;; after the loop, we do the commit if merge-p is t
	 ((or (string= X "U")
	      (string= Y "U"))
	  (setq merge-p t)
	  (shell-command (format "git add %s" FROM)))

	 ;; catch everything else

Here we assume that the last element from org-element-map is the last timestamp found. We get the raw value of that timestamp, insert it, and then use interactive commands to change the timestamp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun insert-ts+1w ()
  "Insert a timestamp at point that is one week later than the
last timestamp found in the buffer."

				(org-element-property :raw-value timestamp)))))))
    (insert last-ts)
    (backward-char 2)
    (org-timestamp-change +7 'day)

  :END:

I have a set of notes for two software packages that contain code examples for each package. I want to selectively extract the code blocks. This post examines a way I could do that. I am going to "tag" each code block with a header. Apparently this is ok, and org-mode ignores the unknown header argument!

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tag package1
print "For use with package1"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: For use with package1

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tag package2
print "For use with package2"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: For use with package2

Apparently, the :tag header argument is stored in the :parameters property as a string.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results raw
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'src-block
  (lambda (element) (org-element-property :parameters element)))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
(:tag package1 :tag package2 :results raw)

So, we just need to map the source blocks, and perform some action on the ones matching the block we want. Here is one example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'src-block
  (lambda (element)
    (let ((tag (org-element-property :parameters element)))
      (cond
       ((null tag) "no parameters")
       ((string-match ":tag\\s-*package1" tag)
	(format "match p1. code:\n%s" (org-element-property :value element)))
       ((string-match ":tag\\s-*package2" tag)
	(format "match p2. code:\n%s" (org-element-property :value element)))
       (t (format "\"%s\"" tag))))))

We also need to conveniently set and change data. We can use setf for this. setf is a generalized version of setq that can take a "place" to set a value to. A "place" can be defined by a cdr, or car, for example. Here is a working example.

* Use org-agenda to select multiple items
  :PROPERTIES:

This is a hacky way to use the org-contacts agenda to get multiple email addresses from a selection. We remap the return key function to call our function that maps over the selected list and gets the emails from it, and finally undoes the remapping before quitting the agenda. It feels a little hacky because you have to communicate through global variable, and the agenda call is not blocking, so the code carries on. I am not sure how to fix that.

** Solution, is ssh batch mode
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       10C7934D-F836-439A-860C-4DEC786AA941
   :END:
The key is modifying the ssh command so that it runs in batch mode. You have to create a custom shell script that runs ssh in batch mode, then set GIT_SSH as an environment variable to use it.

Here is the working script.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle techela_ssh
#!/bin/sh
exec ssh -o "BatchMode yes" "$@"
#end
#+END_SRC

This will not hang.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./techela_ssh bad@techela.cheme.cmu.edu
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

I can write a command that retrieves a repo and opens it. and submits it to the server.

M-x oc-get label
This will check for label, and clone it if needed

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun oc-get (label)
 (interactive)
 (let* ((oc-andrewid "jkitchin")
	(oc-course "06-625")
	(repo (format "%s-%s-%s" oc-course oc-andrewid label)))
 (unless (file-exists-p repo)
   ;; this is the command we need to run
    (format "git clone gitolite@git-it.cheme.cmu.edu:%s" repo))))

(oc-get "hwk1")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: git clone gitolite@git-it.cheme.cmu.edu:06-625-jkitchin-hwk1

We need to be able to update a repo. This will be tricky I think, because if students have made changes, this will not work without merges. It may be possible to commit their changes first, and then just deal with merges, but I think that will be confusing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun oc-update (label)
 (interactive)
 (let* ((oc-andrewid "jkitchin")
	(oc-course "06-625")
	(repo (format "%s-%s-%s" oc-course oc-andrewid label)))
 (unless (file-exists-p repo)
   ;; this is the command we need to run
   (oc-get label)) ;; first get it.

 (let (default-directory repo)
   (format "git pull"))))

#+END_SRC

M-x oc-turn-in

add everything in the directory,  commit it, and push the repo. It looks something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun oc-turn-in ()
  "Run this with the assignment open or in assignment directory"
  (interactive)
  ;; should check that we are in a git repo.

  (shell-command "git add *")
  (shell-command "git commit -am \"done\"")
  (shell-command "git push"))
#+END_SRC

What happens if students delete files?

To calculate the number of months between two dates, we parse the dates to get the year for each date, and the month for each date. Then we calculate the number of months as:

\[12 * (year2 - year1) + (month2 - month1)\]

To get the year,

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nth 5 (decode-time (date-to-time "<2014-05-31 Sat>")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 2014

Now the month:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nth 4 (decode-time (date-to-time "<2014-05-31 Sat>")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Note this subtlety
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(nth 4 (decode-time (date-to-time "<2014-03-01 Sat>")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

It appears that since no time is specified, this gets parsed as the 28th of Feb? Maybe that is a limitation of the date format in Emacs?
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(decode-time (date-to-time "<2014-03-01 Sat>"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We get the right value if we specify the time.

I had an idea to insert a table that represents a rubric into an org-file

| organization |    0.2 | unorganized    | not well organized | logical            |     2 |
| mechanics    |    0.3 | many errors    | a few per page     | no errors          |     4 |
| figures      |    0.1 | inappropriate  | flawed             | proper             |     5 |
| style        |    0.2 | inappropriate  | informal, jargon   | neat               |     6 |
| format       |    0.2 | not followed   | somewhat followed  | conforms to format |     7 |
|--------------+--------+----------------+--------------------+--------------------+-------|
|              |      0 |                |                    | Total              |       |
#+TBLFM: B2=vsum(@1..@5)


You would create the table in advance as a snippet, and you could insert it. Maybe the table would have a name.

* Advising org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c

  :ID:       F733D961-5066-4050-B718-892FAAB95E61
  :END:
I use a lot of equations in org-mode, and I like to use the LaTeX overlays (C-c C-x C-l (org-preview-latex-fragment)). I also use a lot of code blocks in my org-documents, and I like to run them during lectures, which I do with C-c C-c. However, this also removes the overlays from my equations, causing two irritations: 1) the code did not run when I thought it would, and I have to press C-c C-c again, 2) the equations that the code implements disappears so then I have C-c C-x C-l to get them back.  A lot of extra key strokes. The issue is one line in org.el at line 20222: (org-remove-latex-fragment-image-overlays).

I have been thinking about how to change that behavior. I do not want to patch my org-mode, because I do not want to deal with future updates. The simplest idea is to just redefine that function in my init files, with the offending line commented out. Here it is.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  "Set tags in headline, or update according to changed information at point.

This command does many different things, depending on context:

- If a function in `org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook' recognizes this location,
  this is what we do.

- If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.

- If the cursor is in a headline, prompt for tags and insert them
  into the current line, aligned to `org-tags-column'.  When called
  with prefix arg, realign all tags in the current buffer.

- If the cursor is in one of the special #+KEYWORD lines, this
  triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
  information.

- If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
  works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.

- If the cursor is on a #+TBLFM line, re-apply the formulas to
  the entire table.

- If the cursor is at a footnote reference or definition, jump to
  the corresponding definition or references, respectively.

- If the cursor is a the beginning of a dynamic block, update it.

- If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close note and file it.

- If the cursor is on a <<<target>>>, update radio targets and
  corresponding links in this buffer.

- If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
  ordered list.

* Making sure you have a notes entry for each bibtex entry
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
As I mentioned [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/01/08/Finding-bibtex-entries-with-no-downloaded-pdf/][here]], I like to have a notes entry for each bibtex entry in an org-mode file. There are a couple of reasons for that:
1. I can tag the org-mode entries to help me find entries later
2. I can organize the org-mode entries by topic, including using links to entries when they belong in multiple places.
3. I can mark the entry as TODO to make it easy to find unfiled entries
4. I can keep typed notes in these entries.

It is usually part of my workflow to create these entries when I enter the bibtex entry, but occasionally I do not get to that. As part of the regular maintenance of my bibtex file, I like to find entries with no notes entry, and make them.

* TODO A gradebook app for emacs
  :PROPERTIES:
  :categories: emacs-lisp
  :ID:       8B78A517-C25E-4080-87B8-77892385B854
  :END:
The goal is to create an emacs library to compute grades from a table in org-mode.

All grades are stored in a table with this structure.

#+tblname: gradebook
| first name | last name | email       | Hwk 1 | Hwk2 | exam1 | project 1 |
|            |           |             | 10    | 10   | 60    | 20        |
|------------+-----------+-------------+-------+------+-------+-----------|
| Jane       | Doe       | jd@cmu.edu  | A     | A    | B     | B         |
| John       | Dillinger | jdi@cmu.edu | B     | B/C  | A     | C         |
| jill       | wutz      | jw@cmu.edu  | D     | D    | R     | R         |

The grading system works like this:

1. Each assignment is worth a certain number of points (in row2).
2. Each assignment for a student is given a letter grade that indicates the quality and correctness of the work.
3. Each letter grade corresponds to a point multiplier:

| A++ |  1.0 |
| A+  | 0.95 |
| A   |  0.9 |
| A-  | 0.85 |
| A/B |  0.8 |
| B+  | 0.75 |
| B   |  0.7 |
| B-  | 0.65 |
| C/B |  0.6 |
| C+  | 0.55 |
| C   |  0.5 |
| C-  | 0.45 |
| C/D |  0.4 |
| D+  | 0.35 |
| D   |  0.3 |
| D-  | 0.25 |
| D/R |  0.2 |
| R+  | 0.15 |
| R   |  0.1 |
| R-  | 0.05 |
| R-- |  0.0 |

4. The number of points earned for an assignment is the point multiplier for the letter grade times the number of points for that assignment.
5. The overall grade is computed as sum(multiplier*points)/sum(points).
6. The overall letter grade is determined by the fraction of overall points received, mapped back on to the letter grade scale.

For example, in the table above, Jane Doe's grade is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value
(let* ((multipliers '(0.9 0.9 0.7 0.7))
       (points '(10 10 60 20))
       (earned-points (mapcar* (lambda (a b) (* a b)) multipliers points))
       (total-earned-points (apply '+ earned-points))
       (total-points (apply '+ points)))
  (/ total-earned-points total-points))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
: 0.74

Which corresponds to an overall grade of B.

The goal here is to write emacs-lisp code to compute the overall grade of each student and convert it to an overall letter grade and write a little report.

We start by defining a variable to hold the multipliers. We will use an association list. We will prefix every variable and function with =gb/= to indicate it is part of our gradebook code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar gb/MULTIPLIERS
  '(("A++" . 1.0)
    ("A+"   . 0.95)
    ("A"    . 0.9)
    ("A-"   . 0.85)
    ("A/B"  . 0.8)
    ("B+"   . 0.75)
    ("B"    . 0.7)
    ("B-"   . 0.65)
    ("B/C"  . 0.6)
    ("C+"   . 0.55)
    ("C"    . 0.5)
    ("C-"   . 0.45)
    ("C/D"  . 0.4)
    ("D+"   . 0.35)
    ("D"    . 0.3)
    ("D-"   . 0.25)
    ("D/R"  . 0.2)
    ("R+"   . 0.15)
    ("R"    . 0.1)
    ("R-"   . 0.05)
    ("R--"  . 0.0))
  "Numeric multipliers for letter grades")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here are two examples of using the gb/MULTIPLIER variable. It is an association list, so the multipler we want is the =cdr= of what the letter is associated with. We take the =cdr= of the return value, which is the numeric multiplier

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value
(cdr (assoc "A" gb/MULTIPLIERS))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.9

We are going to write a series of functions that will compute the overall grade for each student.

A function we will need is to move the cursor into the table. Here is a function that will do that. This function moves the cursor to the beginning of the buffer, searches forward to find a line starting with a #+tblname: "name", and then moves the cursor to the next line which is in the table.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun gb/goto-table (tblname)
  "move cursor into the table labeled tblname"
  (interactive)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (search-forward-regexp (format "^#\\+tblname:\s+%s" tblname))
  (next-line))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We use the function to move the cursor into the table, and then extract all the contents out.  We wrap the function call inside =save-excursion= so that the cursor gets put back where we want it. In this snippet, we use the (org-table-to-lisp) function to convert the table to a lisp structure which we can do further analysis on.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
;; http://orgmode.org/worg/org-api/org-table-api.html
(require 'org-table) ; needed for access to org-table api

(defun gb/get-gradebook-lisp ()
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (gb/goto-table "gradebook")
    (org-table-to-lisp)))

(gb/get-gradebook-lisp)
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
: (("first name" "last name" "email" "Hwk 1" "Hwk2" "exam1" "project 1") ("" "" "" "10" "10" "60" "20") hline ("Jane" "Doe" "jd@cmu.edu" "A" "A" "B" "B") ("John" "Dillinger" "jdi@cmu.edu" "B" "B/C" "A" "C") ("jill" "wutz" "jw@cmu.edu" "D" "D" "R" "R"))

This is handy. Now we can think about processing the lisp data. Let us get the assignment names, and point values and save them in variables. The assignment names are in the first row, and start in column 3.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(let ((row1 (car (gb/get-gradebook-lisp))))
 (setq gb/ASSIGNMENTS (mapcar 'identity (nthcdr 3 row1))))

gb/ASSIGNMENTS
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ("Hwk 1" "Hwk2" "exam1" "project 1")

And now the point values, and total points.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(let ((row2 (cadr (gb/get-gradebook-lisp))))
 (setq gb/ASSIGNMENT-POINTS (mapcar 'string-to-number (nthcdr 3 row2)))
 (setq gb/TOTAL-POINTS (apply '+ gb/ASSIGNMENT-POINTS)))

(format "ASSIGNMENT-POINTS=%s TOTAL-POINTS=%s" gb/ASSIGNMENT-POINTS gb/TOTAL-POINTS)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: "ASSIGNMENT-POINTS=(10 10 60 20) TOTAL-POINTS=100"

So far, so good. Now, we need to get the letter grades for each student, and turn them into point multipliers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(defun gb/get-multiplier (LG)
  "return numeric multiplier for a letter grade"
  (interactive)
  (cdr (assoc (upcase LG) gb/MULTIPLIERS)))

(defun gb/get-multipliers(LGS)
  "apply get-multiplier to a list of letter grades"
  (interactive)
  (mapcar 'gb/get-multiplier LGS))

(defun gb/get-all-student-multipliers ()
  (mapcar 'gb/get-multipliers
          (mapcar (lambda (x)
                    (nthcdr 3 x))
                  (cdddr (gb/get-gradebook-lisp)))))

(gb/get-all-student-multipliers)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((0.9 0.9 0.7 0.7) (0.7 0.6 0.9 0.5) (0.3 0.3 0.1 0.1))


Finally, we need the product of each multiplier with the gb/ASSIGNMENT-POINTS. This needs some care; some grades may be nil, which we cannot multiply. For now we neglect this detail.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(defun gb/get-earned-points (multipliers)
  (mapcar* (lambda (a  b) (* a b)) multipliers gb/ASSIGNMENT-POINTS))

(defun gb/get-all-earned-points ()
  "returns total points earned by each student"
  (mapcar 'gb/get-earned-points  (gb/get-all-student-multipliers)))

(gb/get-all-earned-points)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((9.0 9.0 42.0 14.0) (7.0 6.0 54.0 10.0) (3.0 3.0 6.0 2.0))

Next, we need to sum all the points and divide by the total points to get the overall numeric grade.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(defun gb/get-all-numeric-grades ()
(mapcar (lambda (x)
          (/ (apply '+ x) gb/TOTAL-POINTS))
          (gb/get-all-earned-points)))

(gb/get-all-numeric-grades)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (0.74 0.77 0.14)

And finally, convert the numeric grades to letter grades. This involves finding the highest letter grade multiplier that the overall grade is larger than.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value verbatim
(defun gb/get-final-letter-grade (grade)
 (dolist (pair gb/MULTIPLIERS letter-grade)
   (if (< (cdr pair) grade)
       (progn
         (setq letter-grade (car pair))
         (return letter-grade)))))

(mapcar 'gb/get-final-letter-grade (gb/get-all-numeric-grades))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ("B" "B+" "R")

That looks good. Now, let's make a final report of the results.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results value
(let ((emails (mapcar '(lambda (x) (nth 2 x)) (cdddr (gb/get-gradebook-lisp))))
      (first-names (mapcar '(lambda (x) (nth 0 x)) (cdddr (gb/get-gradebook-lisp))))
      (last-names (mapcar '(lambda (x) (nth 1 x)) (cdddr (gb/get-gradebook-lisp))))
      (final-grades (mapcar 'gb/get-final-letter-grade (gb/get-all-numeric-grades))))

In a [[http://jkitchin.github.io/blog/2013/01/31/Smooth-transitions-between-discontinuous-functions/][previous post]] I examined a way to switch between discontinuous functions smoothly using a sigmoid function. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function][error function]] has similar properties to the sigmoid function we used previously, and the complementary error function (erfc) is defined as 1 - erf. So, these are two functions we could use to smoothly transition from one function to another.

* TODO Penalizing digital assignments that are turned in late
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       41B38A89-8D4E-462A-8E8B-1A2039BA80CE
  :END:

This semester I have experimented with using box.com to have students turn in assignments. The assignments often have deadlines. For homeworks, we were soft on this, and there was often time between the deadline and when assignments were "collected" for grading. As long as the assignments were available by the time we collected them, we gave students credit for the assignments. Still, some students turned in assignments after that, and we did not have a good strategy for dealing with that.

A new wrinkle came about when I started using box.com to give quizzes and exams. I learned how to make students collaborators on a folder for the duration of the quiz/exam, and then to turn off their ability to upload at the end of the quiz. The first time I ran this, students were unprepared for the amount of time it could take to upload, and a good fraction failed to turn in their quiz. They were /very/ unhappy. I tried modifying the approach to give them a visual timer, with a warning, and a buffer time to enable uploads. That helped, but some were still unable to upload in time. This puts you in an uncomfortable position of telling students they get no credit, or dealing with emails from them of their assignments after they are due, and then figuring out an appropriate penalty. The students are stressed out because they are worried about their grades, and they don't think it is fair. Even if they are deservedly so, worried, stressed out students aren't learning.

Now, I recognize these students should have turned it in when told to, and if this were a paper exam, there is a hard deadline of me walking out the door with the exams. Digitally turned in assignments do not have this kind of behavior. A way to reduce the overall stress around this is that rather than shutting off access to the upload, we should simply use an appropriate late penalty. That way, students get to turn in their work, which is psychologically less stressful, and they are appropriately penalized for being late.

Now, why is this difficult? It turns out it is not that easy to tell when a file is uploaded or modified on box.com. You can do it through the box.com api, but the timestamp comes in an unfamiliar form. Second, late is a difference in time.  The local time on a computer is not the same as the time on the box.com servers, so we cannot (or should not) use that difference to determine lateness.

These timestamps are described [[https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt][here]]. These timestamps are related to utc time, and can be converted to local time like this:

    return utc.astimezone(to_zone)

j = get_item('group-course/test/reference.txt') # created about 930am 12/8

dc = jf['content_created_at']
print utc_to_local(dc)

In fact, I did create that file around 9:31am on 12/8. The =-05:00= is related t the offset of our local time with utc.

Now, the key idea in calculating lateness is that I have a reference time on box.com now, by virtue of having created reference.txt at the beginning of the assignment. I created two assignment files, assignment1.txt and assignment2.txt that I uploaded about 30 seconds, and one minute after the reference.txt was created. Below, I calculate the amount of time elapsed between the reference file and assignment files.

So, now we have a quantitative way to measure lateness. It is not a speedy method, since you have to make several box.com api calls, but, we can say how late it is, and since we use a reference file created on box.com at the beginning of the assignment, we take out the local time issue. The reference file could be created at the end of the assignment to mark when it is done.

Now about the penalty function. This is arbitrary, but should be a function that decays from 100% credit to some lower level of credit that is appropriate. For a homework, you might choose 50% as a floor, with some hours of decay time, whereas for a quiz/exam, it should be minutes of decay time down to 0%. Linear decay is the simplest. Let us say we want the credit to go from 100% to 50% over a 5 minute span. It would look like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

@np.vectorize
def penalty(t):
    if t < (5 * 60):
        p = 1.0 - (1.0 - 0.5) / (5 * 60) * t
    else:
        p = 0.5
    return p

t = np.linspace(0, 600, 100)
p = penalty(t)

plt.plot(t, p)
plt.ylim([0, 1])
plt.ylabel('Late penalty')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.savefig('images/example-penalty.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/example-penalty.png]]

There are many options for a smooth decrease. Let us examine this gaussian function. We define a function that decays in the normal distribution sense, and allows you to set upper and lower bounds. To go from 1.0 to 0.5 we use this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def penalty(t, mu=0.0, sigma=5, ub=1.0, lb = 0.0):
    return (ub - lb) * np.exp(-(t-mu)**2 / (2 * sigma**2)) + lb

t = np.linspace(0, 30)
plt.plot(t, penalty(t, lb=0.5))

plt.ylim([0, 1])
plt.ylabel('Late penalty')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.savefig('images/example-gaussian-penalty.png')
plt.show()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

[[./images/example-gaussian-penalty.png]]

You can see that after about 15 minutes (3 * sigma), the penalty will be


I think this would help reduce stress in the classroom, and make it more systematic to apply lateness penalties to assignments. I still have not worked out precisely how to integrate this into a grading workflow, since you need to run a script to get the penalties for each assignment, and then multiply the grade by it to get the penalized grade. You could grade normally, and have the script create a late file in the directory which is only used in calculating the overall grade.

We have been using org-mode to write manuscripts for submission to journals for publication. Our typical workflow is writing in org-mode, and then using a custom export function to turn the document into LaTeX, and then compiling to pdf via pdflatex. This /mostly/ works great, except for the following two issues:

1. We use BibTex for references, and most journals want us to replace the \bibliography{} lines with the contents of the .bbl file so it is self-contained.
2. We use png files in the org file so they show up in emacs. However, most journals want eps files, and we have to manually remove the .png extension from the LaTeX file so it will build on the journal site (which does not use pdflatex).

I am exploring some code that would automate those things.

** Replacing the bibliography line
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       719AD091-CC35-4059-9F15-39730BBA8CB1
   :END:
Starting with item one, we need to get the contents of the bbl file, and then replace the bibliography line with that. The .bbl file is typically named after the tex file, which is named after the org file. So, if the org-file is blog.org, the tex file would be blog.tex, and the corresponding bbl file would be blog.bbl.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
; derive bbl filename from org file
(concat (file-name-sans-extension (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))) ".bbl")
#+END_SRC

An alternative approach is to replace text using a regexp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(replace-regexp-in-string "org$" "bbl" (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)))
#+END_SRC

Now, we need a way to get the contents of the bbl file. This works:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((bbl-file (replace-regexp-in-string "org$" "bbl" (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name))))
       (contents (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents bbl-file) (buffer-string))))
  (princ contents))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: You got the contents of blog.bbl!

Finally, we should replace the bibliography string in the tex file with the contents of the bbl file. This block seems to do that. I think as long as the bibliography line does not span more than one line, and that there is not more than one of them this should work fine.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((org-file (file-name-nondirectory (buffer-file-name)))
       (bbl-file (replace-regexp-in-string "org$" "bbl" org-file))
       (tex-file (replace-regexp-in-string "org$" "tex" org-file))
       (bbl-contents (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents bbl-file) (buffer-string)))
       (tex-contents (with-temp-buffer (insert-file-contents tex-file) (buffer-string))))
  (with-temp-file tex-file (insert (replace-regexp-in-string "\\\\bibliography{.*}" bbl-contents tex-contents))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

A work flow here would be to run a code block that exports the org-file to LaTeX, then run the code block above to insert the bbl file.

   :END:
We put the .png extension in the figure links in org-mode so that org-mode will show the images in the buffer. That is convenient for writing. It is also fine if one uses pdflatex to compile the resulting LaTeX source. Some journals, however, use latex to build the document, and latex does not support png files; encapsulated postscript is preferrable for latex.

Luckily, you do not have to specify a file extension to latex, it will automatically look for the right extension (.eps for latex, .pdf or .png for pdflatex). So, we just need to strip the extension off of the image paths. Here is a regular expression and code block that seems to do this correctly.

We can combine this with the previous work on replacing the bibliography to replace all the extensions like this.

* Storing INCAR parameters in a json file
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       4764BC3F-8476-4A1E-AD2B-E75455AC7692
  :END:

I am exploring a way to list all the INCAR parameters for VASP in a file format that would allow me to generate the list of keywords in Python /and/ provide documentation in Emacs. Right now these keywords exist in a set of lists in ase.calculators.vasp, with some comments that indicate what they are. However, the only way to access the comments is via the source code. There is no way to show them to the user via a help command. Furthermore, most of the keywords are built in VASP keywords, but some are ase specific. For the VASP keywords, one can search the internet for them, which often brings up the VASP documentation, but sometimes that is slow. For the ase keywords, which implement convenience, one has to read the source. It would be nice to avoid all these issues, and provide documentation that is accessible in an editor too, e.g. in Emacs.

Here we explore doing all of this in a json file. There are json parsers for python and emacs, so it seems possible.

Here is an example of what the json file might look like. The encut documentation is adapted from the VASP documentation

This looks pretty promising. I could have a json file that describes the keywords, provides documentation of the keywords, etc... In python I would use that file to generate the lists that vasp.py uses for each type of keyword, and to provide help functions in python. I could also do that in Emacs too.

It might be confusing for a while that you use symbols instead of strings here. That is changeable with the json-object-type and json-key-type variable which can make them into strings. Here is an example.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output
(require 'json)

(defun incar-help (keyword)
  "return documentation string for keyword"
(interactive)
  (let* ((json-key-type 'string)
	 (my-json (json-read-from-string (with-temp-buffer
					  (insert-file-contents "incar.json")
					  (buffer-string))))
	 (keywords (mapcar (lambda (x) (car x)) my-json)))

    (cdr (assoc "description" (cdr (elt my-json (index keyword keywords)))))))

(princ (incar-help "ispin"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

This seems like a promising approach to provide flexible documentation to the keywords.

Now, we just run [[elisp:(quiz1)]] and we get a "form" to fill out.

On my computer, I get this after I fill it out:

[[./images/quiz1.png]]


After I press submit, this gets emailed to me:

[[./images/quiz1-answers.png]]

It is obviously not perfect, since it did not capture the radio buttons in a useful way, and it collected the Submit and Quit buttons, since they are widgets. Those can probably all be fixed with better code, or maybe more specific code.

It is not too simple to write a quiz like this, but with some practice, and best practice development, it might be pretty straightforward after a while. The benefits are a more tightly controlled quiz environment. Submission may still be tricky, since at least in this case I rely on Emacs being setup for email. Other methods might work too, e.g. an http POST, or saving a file to a shared location.

I want to build an emacs command that views an atoms, or prints a summary of a calculator in a code block. The idea is to get the python code in the block, run it in an interpreter, then view the atoms or print the calculator.

The reason I want to try this is that I often want a quick view of the atoms, but I do not want to import the module, write in the view line, and then comment them out.

    (end-of-line)
    (setq end (point))
    ;(message-box "%s %s %s" start end (buffer-substring start end))
    (buffer-substring start end)))

(defun print-calculator ()
  "print any calculators found in *jasp-calculator*"
  (interactive)
  (python-shell-internal-send-string (concat (get-source) "\n"))
