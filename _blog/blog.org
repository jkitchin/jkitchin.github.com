* scimax 2.0
  :PROPERTIES:
  :categories: emacs,orgmode,ipython
  :END:

It has been a while since I wrote about scimax, and recently there have been some significant updates. They are significant enough that I am calling it scimax 2.0.

** Major update to ipython in org-mode

We used to use a heavily modified, forked version of ob-ipython. Since we forked it, the upstream branch continued developing. In 2.0, we have ditched the old fork, and built on upstream. There are many new features that range from improved async execution, improved control over the output, src-block keybindings like Jupyter, and more. See [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-ipython.org][the documentation]] for all the new features. It is practically equivalent to using a Jupyter notebook now, powered by org-mode.

** org-mime update

Similar to ob-ipython, scimax had a forked version of org-mime. I have removed that, and contributed several improvements to [[https://github.com/org-mime/org-mime][org-mime]] on MELPA. They include:

- Support for file attachments from file-links
- Support for equations in all three message functions
- Support for file tags in org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize

Now, you can send emails from org-mode with equations, citations, figures and attachments! Especially if you use mu4e, you might consider adding these to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mu4e-compose-org-mail ()
  "Open an mu4e message in org-compose mode."
 (interactive)
 (mu4e-compose-new)
 (org-mu4e-compose-org-mode))

(defun htmlize-and-send ()
  "When in an org-mu4e-compose-org-mode message, and not
somewhere C-c C-c should do something useful, htmlize and send
it."
  (interactive)
  (cond
   ((org-in-src-block-p)
    nil)
   (t
    (when (member 'org~mu4e-mime-switch-headers-or-body post-command-hook)
      (org-mime-htmlize nil)
      (message-send-and-exit)))))

(add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'htmlize-and-send t)
#+END_SRC

Then, in a message if your cursor is in the header the buffer is in message-mode, and if it is in the body it is in org-mode. The send function allows you to still send the message with C-c C-c unless the cursor is in a src-block.

** scimax info

I created an info:scimax page for the manual. It is generated from the scimax org manual. If you like info in Emacs, scimax is now in it!

** New scimax modules

Here are a few new modules you might not be familiar with.

*** scimax-inkscape

This library just creates a new org-link that opens a drawing in inkscape, and puts a thumbnail on the link so you can see what it is. I made this to make it easier to insert drawings into org files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scimax-inkscape)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: scimax-inkscape

inkscape:example.svg

*** scimax hydras

I was inspired by a menu in Spacemacs that had keyboard driven navigation to all kinds of functionality, so I made a similar kind of hydra for scimax. I remapped Caps Lock to F12, and use F12 to trigger the hydra. It looks like this:

[[./scimax-hydra.png]]

Many of those open new hydras, so I don't have to remember commands I don't use often. It provides modal navigation, and single-key access to many things.

*** Thumbnails on links

I have long wanted to have graphical thumbnails on data file links. For example, here we create a nanoparticle xyz file, and an thumbnail of what it looks like.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
import ase
from ase.cluster.cubic import FaceCenteredCubic
from ase.io import write

surfaces = [(1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1)]
layers = [6, 9, 5]
lc = 3.61000
atoms = FaceCenteredCubic('Cu', surfaces, layers, latticeconstant=lc)

write('atoms.xyz', atoms) # A data file
write('atoms.png', atoms) # An image file
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[2]:
:END:

We can load this library, and then make a link to the data file with a graphic over it. When you click on the image, it opens the data file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scimax-link-thumbnails)
#+END_SRC

[[./atoms.xyz][atoms.png]]

*** bibtex hotkeys

 Org-mode has hot-keys that are active at the start of headlines, and src blocks. lispy also has hotkeys that work at the beginning and end of sexps. This is such a good idea, I made hotkeys for bibtex entries. This library makes hotkeys in bibtex files when your cursor is at the beginning of an entry.

 Here are the currently defined keys. Now you can email an entry and its associated pdf to someone by pressing "e"!

 #+RESULTS:
 | ? | Show hotkeys           |
 | I | Inspect                |
 | S | Sentence-case title    |
 | T | Title-case article     |
 | U | Update entry           |
 | b | Open in browser        |
 | c | Copy entry             |
 | e | Email entry            |
 | f | Copy formatted         |
 | k | Kill the entry         |
 | l | Clean entry            |
 | n | Jump to next entry     |
 | p | Jump to previous entry |
 | q | Jump to field with avy |
 | s | Move entry up          |
 | w | Move entry down        |
 | y | Paste last entry       |
 | / | helm-bibtex            |

*** new feature in ox-clip

You can now put your cursor on a LaTeX fragment or image, and run ox-clip-image-to-clipboard to copy the image to the clipboard so you can paste it in MS Word or a Google Doc.

*** Functional text that isn't an orgmode link

This was inspired by Hyperbole, which makes some text functional, e.g. you can click on it and open a website. I wanted richer functionality than that, usually a hydra menu that gives me several options, and actions that act on parts of the text. You load this functionality with this in your init file.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'scimax-functional-text)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : scimax-functional-text


Now things like email addresses (johnrkitchin@gmail.com), @handles (@jkitchin), and hashtags (#research), even Github issues, commits and pull requests, etc. will be clickable.

Clicking on them will run some action like opening a menu of actions you might want to perform, for example on an email, you might want to send an email to that address, or look it up in your contacts. An @handle might be for Twitter, or some other social network. If you click on one or type s-<return>, you will get a hydra menu of action items. For Github items, they are only activated if the buffer is in a current git-project. For these, you get a hydra that can jump to a commit in Magit, or to the log, or to a url on Github (if it can figure it out). These are otherwise plain text that are marked up by font-lock so they export as plain text. So they are complementary to org-links.

If you want to make your own functional text, there is a convenient macro that is more powerful than button-lock-set-button. It allows you to define an action body, or function, and gives you access to the subgroups of the regexp in the action. Here is an example for phone numbers using the rx module to define the regular expression to match any of the following numbers:

515 867 5304
515-867-5304
515.867.5304
(515) 867 5304

You can click on the number or press RET with the cursor on the number to activate the action, in this case we just give ourselves a message in the minibuffer. The tooltip also has access to numbered regexp groups. A better use would be to call the number, or perhaps look it up in your contact database. I use rx to create a regular expression with subgroups, and those are accessible in the action, and the tooltip!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(button-lock-mode -1)
(button-lock-unregister-all-global-buttons)
(scimax-functional-text
 (rx
  ;; optional () around area code
  (group-n 1
	   (optional "(")
	   (= 3 digit)
	   (optional ")"))
  ;; delimiters
  (group-n 2
	   (or (optional "-")
	       (optional ".")
	       (optional " "))
	   (= 3 digit)
	   (or (optional "-")
	       (optional ".")
	       (optional " ")))
  (group-n 3
	   (= 4 digit)))
 ((message "calling %s" (match-string 0)))
 :face '((:background "Darkolivegreen2")
	 (:underline t))
 :help-echo (lambda (win buf pt)
	      (message "area code: %s\n3: %s\n4: %s"
		       (match-string 1)
		       (match-string 2)
		       (match-string 3)))
 :keyboard-binding (kbd "RET"))

(button-lock-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

That is some macro magic there.

It is not quite as powerful as hyperbole in some ways. For example only one button is active at a time on a bit of text, so if there are overlapping patterns (e.g., in issue #563 there could be a git issue and a hashtag) whatever was font-locked last is probably what is active. I haven't figured out a way to get all the possible contexts and offer all the possible actions. This will have to turn out to be more useful to invest time in solving that.

*** A scimax dashboard

 I thought it would be fun to have an interactive dashboard. This shows you several sections with links to scimax documentation,  your daily agenda, recent files, bookmarks, and projects. It will even tell you if your repo is up to date!

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'dashboard)
(require 'scimax-dashboard)

(scimax-dashboard)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : #<buffer *dashboard*>

*** A better markdown exporter

 I had some need for a better Markdown exporter. See this [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-md/scimax-md.md][example]] for the improvements. The main features are better citations and a bibliography, fixing cross-references in the document, better handling of a project. I still like org-mode /way/ more, but Github seems to render the Markdown more nicely, which might be better for some purposes.

 I get a lot of articles this way. The current size of the database is:

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(elfeed-db-size)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : 79721

 Elfeed tells me I have over 300 unread entries to review at the moment.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(elfeed-search--count-unread)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : 341/363:24

 To deal with this deluge, I have done a couple of things. I set up some new key-bindings so I can alternate marking entries as read if the titles do not look interesting. These keybindings let me alternate fingers, so they do not get too tired (that really happens some days!).

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; help me alternate fingers in marking entries as read
(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "f") 'elfeed-search-untag-all-unread)
(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "j") 'elfeed-search-untag-all-unread)
 #+END_SRC

 I also set up some auto-tagging of the emacs and python feeds, and setup some custom faces so these tags are highlighted so they are easy to see. Anything highlighted in blue is related to emacs, green is related to python, and pink is related to my department, and I can type s, then the tag to see only those entries.  Here is what my feed looks like:

 #+attr_org: :width 600
 [[./screenshots/date-05-01-2017-time-08-42-33.png]]



 Today I want to explore adding tags to entries to further prioritize them. There is a way to tag entries that is described here: https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed#tag-hooks where you can create patterns to match an entry feed title, url, title or link. Basically, you create a function that takes an entry, amd have it add or remove a tag conditionally.

 I want to tag entries that meet certain criteria, for example keywords, and set a tag based on the number of matches. Ideally, one day this would be integrated with machine learning so it could rank entries by other entries I have liked, but today we setup code that will create a score for an entry based on the number of matches, and then tag it so that it will get highlighted for me.  First, we define two custom faces and setup elfeed to use them. I will use two tags: important and relevant. relevant will be for entries that get a score of at least 1, and important for entries that get a score greater than 1.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(defface relevant-elfeed-entry
  `((t :background ,(color-lighten-name "orange1" 40)))
  "Marks a relevant Elfeed entry.")

(defface important-elfeed-entry
  `((t :background ,(color-lighten-name "OrangeRed2" 40)))
  "Marks an important Elfeed entry.")

(push '(relevant relevant-elfeed-entry)
      elfeed-search-face-alist)

(push '(important important-elfeed-entry)
      elfeed-search-face-alist)
 #+END_SRC

 In elfeed, each entry is a structure, and we can access the title and content for matching. Here is an example of a simple scoring function. The idea is just to match patterns, and then add to the score if it matches. This is not as advanced as [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Scoring.html#Scoring][gnus scoring]], but it is a good starting point.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun score-elfeed-entry (entry)
  (let ((title (elfeed-entry-title entry))
	(content (elfeed-deref (elfeed-entry-content entry)))
	(score 0))
    (loop for (pattern n) in '(("alloy" 1)
			       ("machine learning\\|neural" 1)
			       ("database" 1)
			       ("reproducible" 1)
			       ("carbon dioxide\\|CO2" 1)
			       ("oxygen evolution\\|OER\\|electrolysis" 1)
			       ("perovskite\\|polymorph\\|epitax" 1)
			       ("kitchin" 2))
	  if (string-match pattern title)
	  do (incf score n)
	  if (string-match pattern content)
	  do (incf score n))
    (message "%s - %s" title score)

    ;; store score for later in case I ever integrate machine learning
    (setf (elfeed-meta entry :my/score) score)

    (cond
     ((= score 1)
      (elfeed-tag entry 'relevant))
     ((> score 1)
      (elfeed-tag entry 'important)))
    entry))

(add-hook 'elfeed-new-entry-hook 'score-elfeed-entry)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 | score-elfeed-entry |

 Now, new entries automatically get tagged with relevant or important, depending on the score that function gives them, and they get color-coded. Now, the feed looks like this:

 #+attr_org: :width 600
 [[./screenshots/date-05-01-2017-time-11-10-42.png]]


 I saved some bookmarks to see just the important or relevant ones (http://nullprogram.com/blog/2015/12/03/) so I can see new relevant entries with C-x r b and selecting the relevant bookmark. These work from anywhere in Emacs.

 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  @6-months-ago +unread +relev  @6-months-ago +unread +relevant
  elfeed @6-months-ago +unread  @6-months-ago +unread +important
 #+END_EXAMPLE

 I usually access elfeed from a command that shows me everything. Here, I define key-bindings to show me just the important or relevant ones. I could not see a way to get an or in there to show me both of them. These keys make it a one key press to show only these entries, and then get back to the full list.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "i")
  (lambda () (interactive)
    (elfeed-search-set-filter "@6-months-ago +unread +important")))

(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "v")
  (lambda () (interactive)
    (elfeed-search-set-filter "@6-months-ago +unread +relevant")))

(define-key elfeed-search-mode-map (kbd "c")
  (lambda () (interactive)
    (elfeed-search-set-filter "@6-months-ago +unread")))
 #+END_SRC


 That summarizes the experiment of the day. There is clearly some room for improvement on the scoring function, e.g. moving the patterns out of the function and into a customizable variable, making the patterns be specific to either the title or content, etc. I am going to try this for a few days and see if it is actually helpful first though.

* DONE Querying a MongoDB bibtex database with Python and emacs-lisp

I have been exploring [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/03/Find-stuff-in-org-mode-anywhere/][using databases]] to help with searching my data. In this post we explore using MongoDB for bibtex entries. I am choosing bibtex entries because it is easy to parse bibtex files, I already have a lot of them, and I have several kinds of queries I regularly use. So, they are a good candidate to test out a new database on!

MongoDB is a noSQL database that is pretty easy to use. I installed it from homebrew, and then followed the directions to run the server.

With pymongo you can make a database as easy as this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
import bibtexparser

# Read the bibtex file to get entries
with open('../../../Dropbox/bibliography/references.bib', 'r') as bibfile:
    bp = bibtexparser.load(bibfile)
    entries = bp.entries

print("N = ", len(entries))

print(entries[0])

import pymongo
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient('localhost', 27017)

# This creates the "entries" collection
db = client['bibtex'].entries

# add each entry
for entry in entries:
    db.insert_one(entry)
#+END_SRC

That was easy. We have a database with 1671 documents in it, and each document is essentially a dictionary of key-value pairs. You might even argue it was too easy. I didn't specify any structure to the entries at all. No required fields, no validation that the keys are spelled correctly, no validation on the values, e.g. you can see the year looks like a string. The benefit of that is that every entry went in, with no issues. On the other hand, the authors went in as a single string, as did the keywords, which affects our ability to search a little bit later. Note if you run that twice, it will add each entry again, since we do not check if the entry already exists.

A database is only useful though if it is easy to get stuff out of it. So, let's consider some test queries. First we find entries that have years less than 1950. The query is basically a little json bundle that describes a field and condition that we want to match. Here we use a less than operator, ""$lt"The results come back as a list of dictionaries. This is in stark contrast to a SQL query which is an expression in its own declarative language. A query here is a chunk of data that must get converted to code by the server. I am not 100% clear if the less than here is in the string sense or numeric sense, but for years it probably does not matter for a long time.

That seems easy enough, and those strings could easily be used as candidates for a selection tool like helm.

How about articles published by myself and my student Jacob Boes? This requires "and" logic. Apparently that is the default, so we just add three queries. One is an exact match on articles, and the other two are case-insensitive regular expression matches.  I guess this has to be done on every document, since there probably is no way to index a regex match! This search was very fast, but it is not clear how fast it would be for a million entries. This matching is necessary because we stored all authors in a single field rather than splitting them into an array. We might still have to match strings for this even in an array since an author might then be "John R. Kitchin", rather than further decomposed into first and last names.

We can find out how many different entry types we have, as well as how many distinct keyword entries there are. The documents do not separate the keywords though, so this is just the unique strings of comma-separated keywords values. We would have had to split those in advance to have a list of keywords to search for a specific one beyond string matching. Curiously, in my bibtex entries, these are in a field called "keywords". It appears the bibtex parser may have changed the name to "keyword".

** text searching

You can do text search as well. You first have to create an index on one or more fields, and then use the $text and $search operators. Here I made an index on a few fields, and then searched on it. Note that you can only have one text index, so think about it in advance! This simplifies the query a bit, we do not have to use the regex syntax for matching on a field.

** Querying from emacs-lisp

It is hard to get too excited about this if it is not easy to query from emacs and get data in a form we can use in emacs ;) The json library allows us to convert lisp data structures to json pretty easily. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'json)

(json-encode '((ENTRYTYPE . article)
	       (author . (($regex . kitchin)
			  ($options . i)))
	       (author . (($regex . boes)
			  ($options . i)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {"ENTRYTYPE":"article","author":{"$regex":"kitchin","$options":"i"},"author":{"$regex":"boes","$options":"i"}}

So, we can use an a-list syntax to build up the query. Then we can send it to mongo using mongoexport that will return a json string that we can read back into emacs to get lisp data. Here is an example that returns a query. We print the first element here.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(pp
 (aref (json-read-from-string
	(shell-command-to-string
	 (format "mongoexport --quiet --jsonArray -d bibtex -c entries -q '%s'"
		 (json-encode '((ENTRYTYPE . article)
				(author . (($regex . kitchin)
					   ($options . i)))
				(author . (($regex . boes)
					   ($options . i))))))))
       0))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
((_id
  ($oid . "5878d9644c114f59fe86cb36"))
 (author . "Jacob R. Boes and Peter Kondratyuk and Chunrong Yin and James\nB. Miller and Andrew J. Gellman and John R. Kitchin")
 (year . "2015")
 (title . "Core Level Shifts in {Cu-Pd} Alloys As a Function of Bulk\nComposition and Structure")
 (ENTRYTYPE . "article")
 (ID . "boes-2015-core-cu")
 (keyword . "DESC0004031, early-career")
 (volume . "640")
 (doi . "10.1016/j.susc.2015.02.011")
 (link . "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.susc.2015.02.011")
 (issn . "0039-6028")
 (journal . "Surface Science")
 (pages . "127-132"))
#+end_example

That is pretty sweet, we get a lisp data structure we can use. We can wrap that into a reasonable looking function here:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-find (db collection query)
  (json-read-from-string
   (shell-command-to-string
    (format "mongoexport --quiet --jsonArray -d %s -c %s -q '%s'"
	    db collection (json-encode query)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-find

Now we can use the function to query the database, and then format the results. Here we look at the example of articles with authors that match "kitchin" and "boes".

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(loop for counter from 1 for entry across
      (mongo-find "bibtex" "entries" '((ENTRYTYPE . article)
				       (author . (($regex . kitchin)
						  ($options . i)))
				       (author . (($regex . boes)
						  ($options . i)))))
      do
      (setq entry (append `(,(cons "counter" counter)) entry))
      ;; make sure we have a doi field.
      (if (assoc 'doi entry)
	  (push (cons "doi" (format "https://doi.org/%s" (cdr (assoc 'doi entry)))) entry)
	(push (cons "doi" "") entry))
      concat
      (concat (replace-regexp-in-string
	       "\n" " "
	       (s-format "${counter}. ${author}, ${title} (${year}). ${doi}"
			 'aget entry)) "\n"))

Wow, that looks like a pretty lispy way to query the database and use the results. It is probably pretty easy to do similar things for inserting and updating documents. I will save that for another day.

** Summary thoughts

This is not an exhaustive study of Mongo for a bibtex database. It does illustrate that it is potentially useful. Imagine a group of users can enter bibtex entries, and then share them through a central server. Or you query the server for entries and then select them using helm/ivy. That is probably faster than parsing large bibtex files (note, in org-ref I already cache the files in parsed form for performance reasons!).

It would make sense to split the authors, and keywords in another version of this database. It also could make sense to have a field that is the bibtex string, and to do text search on that string. That way you get everything in the entry for searching, and an easy way to generate bibtex files without having to reconstruct them.

It is especially interesting to run the queries through emacs-lisp since we get the benefit of editing lisp code while writing the query, e.g. parenthesis navigation, less quoting, etc... and we get back lisp data that can be used to construct helm/ivy queries, or other emacs things. That makes this look competitive with emacsql at least for the syntax. I predict that there will be more posts on this in the future.
* DONE A simple emacs-lisp interface to CRUD operations in mongodb

  :END:

In this [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/15/Querying-a-MongoDB-bibtex-database-with-Python-and-emacs-lisp/][post]] I showed that MongoDB is pretty easy to use for simple database applications. I showed a way to get data out of the database that is native to Emacs, but to use Mongo in emacs applications comfortably, it would be really helpful to be able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) entries. There is a minimal interface to mongodb for emacs-lisp here: https://github.com/m2ym/mongo-el. From what I can see, it seems limited to simple, single queries, and it is written with advanced features of emacs-lisp I do not understand enough to extend it. In the last post, I showed an easy way to use mongoexport to get data from a query out of a mongo database. Here I explore a similar approach to round out the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations for using emacs-lisp to work with mongodb. This will enable Emacs to easily use MongoDB in applications.

We use the mongo cli with the --eval option, which allows you to run commands on the database. The basic idea is to generate the json we need from a lisp data structure, and use that json in mongo commands as needed. This sounds simple, but below you will see there are plenty of corners to take care of.

The goal here is to get something that is pretty functional. It will not be able to support all the capabilities of MongoDB and the options available in the cli.

** Inserting entries

Here we insert a document into the contacts collection of the contacts database. As in the Python example we considered earlier, this database is automatically created when we run this command.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'json))
(let* ((json (json-encode '((first-name . "John")
			    (last-name . "Kitchin")
			    (email . "jkitchin@cmu.edu"))))
       (cmd (format "mongo 127.0.0.1/contacts --quiet --eval 'db.contacts.insert(%s)'"
		    json)))
  (shell-command-to-string cmd))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: json

Here is a function we can use for inserting, and as you can see it works for multiple inserts too. There is a limit on how long the json string can be for this, so you cannot add too many entries at once with this. I do not know what the limit is, and suspect it is related to using a shell command. When this succeeds there is data returned about what happened, which we try to get in lisp form. Also, I noticed I had to do a little bit of escaping, especially for entries containing a single quote, which messes up the quoting on the shell command, and for non-ascii characters which the shell did not handle well. Maybe this could be avoided with a file-based approach, or if we used a pipe to a process.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-insert (db collection document)
  "Insert into DB.COLLECTION the DOCUMENT.
DOCUMENT will be some lisp structure that is converted to json."
  ;; we have to escape quote any single quotes. This came from
  ;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1250079/how-to-escape-single-quotes-within-single-quoted-strings
  (let* ((json (replace-regexp-in-string "'" "'\"'\"'" (json-encode document)))
	 ;; it seems utf-8 characters may cause issues. Let's just remove them.
	 (json (replace-regexp-in-string "[^[:ascii:]]" "" json))
	 (cmd (format "mongo %s --quiet --eval 'db.%s.insert(%s)'"
		      db collection
		      json))
	 (output (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
    (cond
     ((string-match "BulkWriteResult(" output)
      (json-read-from-string (substring output 16 -2)))
     ((string-match "WriteResult(" output)
      (json-read-from-string (substring output 12 -2)))
     (t
      output))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-insert

Here it is in action.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-insert "contacts" "contacts"
	      '(((first-name . "John")
		 (last-name . "Kitchin")
		 (email . "jkitchin@cmu.edu"))
		((first-name . "Someone")
		 (last-name . "Else")
		 ("email" . "someone@out.there"))))

#+RESULTS:
: ((writeErrors . []) (writeConcernErrors . []) (nInserted . 2) (nUpserted . 0) (nMatched . 0) (nModified . 0) (nRemoved . 0) (upserted . []))

Seems like an ok way to get data from Emacs into a Mongo DB, and we get lisp data returned telling us what happened.

** Finding a document

To update documents we need to find them. We would like to find a document by the _id, but we have a small dilemma. The json we need for that needs to look like: {"_id": ObjectId("587babfaef131d0d4603b3ad")}, where the ObjectId is not quoted. The json library does not seem to be able to do that. So, we have to modify our find code to do this. This is possible by manipulating the json string after it is generated with regular expression replacement. It feels hacky, and hopefully there are not many more examples of that. If there are, we will need another approach to generating the json data. Here is the modified find function, also with the projection option. Here is another place we have to tread somewhat lightly with the _id, in this case we have to requote it so that it can be read by emacs. It might make sense to just replace it with the quoted _id string, rather than the ObjectId call. Time will tell.

Here we create two helper functions to unquote input, and requote output. We also need some code to make an array of all the results, and put commas between all the results so that we end up with valid json in the output.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-unquote-query (query)
  "Json encodes QUERY, and unquotes any ObjectId calls.

We don't have syntax for the ObjectId call that mongo wants in
 lisp, so a query has to look like this:
'((_id .  \"ObjectId(\"587babfaef131d0d4603b3ad\")\"))

Mongo can't have the quotes around the call, so this function
removes them.
"
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\"\\(ObjectID(\\\\\"\\(.*?\\)\\\\\")\\)\""
			    "ObjectId(\"\\2\")"
			    (json-encode query)))

(defun mongo-requote-output (output)
  "Adds quotes around ObjectId in OUTPUT.
When mongo outputs json, it has unquoted ObjectIds in it that
emacs cannot interpret as json. "
  (replace-regexp-in-string
   "ObjectId(\"\\(.*?\\)\")"
   "\"ObjectId(\\\\\"\\1\\\\\")\""
   output))

(defun mongo-find (db collection query &optional projection)
  (let* ((query-json (mongo-unquote-query query))
	 (projection-json
	  (and projection (json-encode projection)))
	 (output (mongo-requote-output
		  ;; add [] to make an array of output in json,
		  ;; and separate results by a comma
		  (concat "["
			  (replace-regexp-in-string
			   "\n" ""
			   (shell-command-to-string
			    (format "mongo %s --quiet --eval 'db.%s.find(%s).forEach(function(myDoc) { printjsononeline(myDoc); print( \",\"); })'"
				    db collection
				    (if projection
					(format "%s, %s" query-json projection-json)
				      query-json))))
			  "]"))))
    (json-read-from-string output)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-find

So, finally we can run something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '((email . "someone@out.there")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c166cdfcd649d3acf99fd\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c17550e586b4f8df21de0\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c1764d75279a55ffec483\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c17743281f1e9d5054396\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c178ad92706d2bd5a6e3c\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c1794756bb2bd0f0ac499\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there"))]

Here is an example usage with a projection that returns only the information you want, in this case, just the id.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '((email . "someone@out.there"))
	    '((_id . 1)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c166cdfcd649d3acf99fd\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c17550e586b4f8df21de0\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c1764d75279a55ffec483\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c17743281f1e9d5054396\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c178ad92706d2bd5a6e3c\")")) ((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c1794756bb2bd0f0ac499\")"))]

** Updating an entry

Ok, back to the update. To make sure that we update exactly the document we want, we will use the document _id. First, we define an update command.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-update (db collection query $set)
  "In DB.COLLECTION update records matching QUERY with the contents of $SET."
  (let* ((query-json (mongo-encode-query query))
	 ($set-json (mongo-encode-query $set))
	 (cmd (format "mongo %s --quiet --eval 'db.%s.update(%s, %s)'"
		      db collection
		      query-json $set-json))
	 (output (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
    (if (string-match "WriteResult(" output)
	(json-read-from-string
	 (substring output 12 -2))
      output)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-update

First a reminder of what is in this record.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there"))]

Here we set the email field to a new address. Without $set, the whole document gets replaced.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-update "contacts" "contacts"
	      '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")"))
	      '(($set . ((email . "someone@out.there.com")))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((nMatched . 1) (nUpserted . 0) (nModified . 1))

Finally, let's see the document again to verify it is modified.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")") (first-name . "Someone") (last-name . "Else") (email . "someone@out.there.com"))]

Looks good, you can see it got changed. There is a potential gotcha though. This next command looks like it should do the same thing, but it does not. The whole document gets replaced!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-update "contacts" "contacts"
	      '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")"))
	      '((email . "someone@out.there.com")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((nMatched . 1) (nUpserted . 0) (nModified . 1))

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [((_id . "ObjectId(\"587c16ad410565dd4c16c748\")") (email . "someone@out.there.com"))]

Do not forget the $set operator if you just want to update some fields!

** Deleting a document

Next, let's get a delete function. I will only implement the deleteMany function here since you can give it a document id to delete only one, and usually I would want to delete all documents that meet a criteria anyway.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-deleteMany (db collection filter)
  "Delete records in DB.COLLECTION matched by FILTER.
TODO: add write concern."
  (let* ((filter-json (mongo-encode-query filter))
	 (cmd (format "mongo %s --quiet --eval 'db.%s.deleteMany(%s)'"
		      db collection
		      filter-json))
	 (output (shell-command-to-string cmd)))
    (json-read-from-string output)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-deleteMany

Since we borked that last document, let's just delete it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-deleteMany "contacts" "contacts" '((_id . "ObjectId(\"587be3fa6009a569a277b680\")")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ((acknowledged . t) (deletedCount . 0))

** Generic commands

We may want some flexibility to run collection commands.  The most generic command will simply be to write the shell-command completely. We can keep a little syntax by encapsulating most of the boilerplate though. Here is a function for that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun mongo-cmd (db collection cmd &rest args)
  "In DB.COLLECTION run CMD.
ARGS if present will be used to format CMD."
  (shell-command-to-string
   (format "mongo %s --quiet --eval 'db.%s.%s'"
	   db collection
	   (apply #'format cmd args))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: mongo-cmd

We can get the number of documents with this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "count()")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4341

Or run a more sophisticated command with arguments like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "explain().remove(%s)" (json-encode '(("category" . "enemy"))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
{
	"queryPlanner" : {
		"plannerVersion" : 1,
		"namespace" : "contacts.contacts",
		"indexFilterSet" : false,
		"parsedQuery" : {
			"category" : {
				"$eq" : "enemy"
			}
		},
		"winningPlan" : {
			"stage" : "DELETE",
			"inputStage" : {
				"stage" : "COLLSCAN",
				"filter" : {
					"category" : {
						"$eq" : "enemy"
					}
				},
				"direction" : "forward"
			}
		},
		"rejectedPlans" : [ ]
	},
	"serverInfo" : {
		"host" : "Johns-MacBook-Air.local",
		"port" : 27017,
		"version" : "3.4.1",
		"gitVersion" : "5e103c4f5583e2566a45d740225dc250baacfbd7"
	},
	"ok" : 1
}
#+end_example

Or, drop the collection with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "drop()")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: true

All gone! Note, we do not try to handle the output of any of those, and they are returned as strings.

** A MongoDB contacts database

Now, let's re-populate it for real. I store my contacts in a variable called "contacts" as a list of a descriptive string and then cons cells. These are actually harvested from a set of org-files. It is way to slow to parse these files each time, so I keep the contacts cached in memory and only update them if a file changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(length contacts)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6047

There are over 6000 contacts. Let's put them in a MongoDB.

Here is a limitation of our approach. This will not work because the generated shell command ends up being too long for the shell.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-insert "contacts" "contacts"
	      (loop for contact in contacts
		    collect
		    (append `((desc . ,(car contact))) (cdr contact))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

So, we do them one at time here:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((ct (current-time)))
  (loop for contact in contacts
	do
	(let ((output (mongo-insert "contacts" "contacts"
				    (append `((desc . ,(car contact))) (cdr contact)))))
	  (unless (= 1 (cdr (assoc 'nInserted output)))
	    (warn "error: %S for %S" (cdr (assoc 'nInserted output)) contact))))
  (message "Elapsed time %.02f seconds" (float-time (time-since ct))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Elapsed time 762.95 seconds

That took a little over 10 minutes to add. That seems long to me. This next step confirms that they were added.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "count()")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6047

Next we will compare some timing of finding data in the database vs looping through the cached contacts. Here is a timing macro to measure how long it takes to run a bit of code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23622296/emacs-timing-execution-of-function-calls-in-emacs-lisp
(defmacro measure-time (&rest body)
  "Measure the time it takes to evaluate BODY."
  `(let ((time (current-time)))
     ,@body
     (message "%.06f seconds elapsed" (float-time (time-since time)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: measure-time

Here is the old way I would extract data. Many contacts I have are academics, and I have stored their academic ranks in each contact.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(loop for contact in contacts
      if (string= "Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
      collect contact into professors
      if (string= "Associate Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
      collect contact into associate-professors
      if (string= "Assistant Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
      collect contact into assistant-professors
      finally return `(("Assistant Professor" ,(length assistant-professors))
		       ("Associate Professor" ,(length associate-professors))
		       ("Professor" ,(length professors))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Assistant Professor | 313 |
| Associate Professor | 283 |
| Professor           | 879 |

How long did it take to do that?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(measure-time
 (loop for contact in contacts
       if (string= "Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
       collect contact into professors
       if (string= "Associate Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
       collect contact into associate-professors
       if (string= "Assistant Professor" (cdr (assoc "RANK" (cdr contact))))
       collect contact into assistant-professors
       finally return (list (length assistant-professors)
			    (length associate-professors)
			    (length professors))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.008772 seconds elapsed

Not long at all! Comparatively, it is very slow to get this information out of the mongodb, although considerably less code is required. That might not be surprising, considering the json parsing that has to get done here.

Here is the equivalent code to extract that data from the database.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(loop for rank in '("Assistant Professor" "Associate Professor" "Professor")
       collect (list rank (length (mongo-find "contacts" "contacts"
					      `((RANK . ,rank))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Assistant Professor | 313 |
| Associate Professor | 283 |
| Professor           | 879 |

It is comparatively slow to do this. This requires three json parses, and profiling indicates that alot of the work is done in parsing the json.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(measure-time
 (loop for rank in '("Assistant Professor" "Associate Professor" "Professor")
       collect (list rank (length (mongo-find "contacts" "contacts"
					      `((RANK . ,rank)))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 1.914817 seconds elapsed

Here is smarter way to do it that avoids the json parsing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(loop for rank in '("Assistant Professor" "Associate Professor" "Professor")
      collect (list rank (mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "count(%s)"
				    (json-encode `((RANK . ,rank))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| Assistant Professor | 313 |
| Associate Professor | 283 |
| Professor           | 879 |

And you can see here it is about 10 times faster, but not nearly as fast as running the lisp code on the cache.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(measure-time
 (loop for rank in '("Assistant Professor" "Associate Professor" "Professor")
       collect (list rank (mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "count(%s)"
				     (json-encode `((RANK . ,rank)))))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.349413 seconds elapsed

This is how you might integrate this into a completion command:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(ivy-read "choose: "
	  (loop for c across (mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" "")
		collect
		(list (cdr (assoc 'desc c)) c)))
#+END_SRC

This is basically unusable though, because it takes so long to generate the candidates (over six seconds).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(measure-time
 (loop for c across (mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" "")
       collect
       (list (cdr (assoc 'desc c)) c)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6.228225 seconds elapsed

We can get back to usable by making the database do more work for us. Here, we simply make the database print a list of cons cells that we can read into lisp. We have to use a javascript function, with some escaping and quoting. The escaping was necessary because there is some bad data in the email field that messed up the cons cells, e.g. some things like "name" <email> with nested single and double quoting, etc., and the quoting was necessary to get cons cells of the form ("desc" . "email"), and finally we wrap them in parentheses and read back the list of cons cells. At about a quarter of a second, this is very usable to get a list of over 6000 candidates. It is still many times slower than working on the contacts list in memory though. I am not a super fan of the one-line javascript, and if it was much more complicated than this another strategy would probably be desirable.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(measure-time
 (read
  (concat
   "("
   (shell-command-to-string "mongo contacts --quiet --eval 'db.contacts.find().forEach(function (doc) {print(\"(\\\"\" + doc.desc + \"\\\" . \\\"\" + escape(doc.EMAIL) +\"\\\")\");})'")
   ")")))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0.284730 seconds elapsed

** Text searching

Finally, let us make a text index to make searching easy. This allows us a very flexible search where we do not have to specify what field or use regular expressions. We setup the index on all the fields, so we can find entries that match even on fields that do not exist in all documents.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(mongo-cmd "contacts" "contacts" "createIndex(%s)" (json-encode '(("$**" . "text"))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: {
: 	"createdCollectionAutomatically" : false,
: 	"numIndexesBefore" : 1,
: 	"numIndexesAfter" : 2,
: 	"ok" : 1
: }

Now, let's use that to find the GOOGLE-SCHOLAR url of contacts matching the following query.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results code
(mongo-find "contacts" "contacts" '(($text . (($search . "\"Carnegie Mellon\"")))
				    ($text . (($search . "\"John Kitchin\""))))
	    '((GOOGLE-SCHOLAR . 1) (_id . 0)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
[((GOOGLE-SCHOLAR . "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jD_4h7sAAAAJ"))
 nil nil]
#+END_SRC

So, you can see there were three contacts, and one of them lists my google-scholar url.

** Summary

This looks like the foundation of a mongo/emacs-lisp interface. This interface is not that fast though, and suffers from some limitations related to the use of the shell. Depending on the actual use, it is clear you can gain performance by passing some work on the database, which requires some javascript coding. Even that revealed some subtlety, e.g. making sure the database output text that was compatible with the lisp reader. That mostly means taking care of quotes, and other special characters, which I managed with a simple escape mechanism. It is probably worth investing a few more days in building an interface that uses a process and communicates with the mongo cli directly before moving forward with any significant application that uses Mongo in emacs. There are many good ideas for that:

1. Index all your org files (e.g. http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/03/Find-stuff-in-org-mode-anywhere/)
2. Index all your bibtex files (e.g. http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/15/Querying-a-MongoDB-bibtex-database-with-Python-and-emacs-lisp/)
3. Download RSS feeds into a searchable database
4. Manage your contacts
5. Index your email? mu and notmuch use xapian for this, but I have found they cannot search for things like hashtags. Maybe MongoDB would be better?

The tradeoffs between this and sqlite are more clear now. With Mongo we do not have to create the normalized tables (although it is still a good idea to think about how to structure the documents, and if they should be a little normalized). It is /much/ easier to map lisp data structures to Mongo queries than it is to do that with SQL queries. On the other hand, it is necessary to do some javascript programming with Mongo to get some desired output. It still seems worth exploring further.
* DONE ob-ipython and inline figures in org-mode

  :END:

[[https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython][ob-ipython]] provides some nice support for inline images, but it is a little limited. You can only have one inline plot, and you cannot capture the printed output. I often want both, and use more than one figure in a code block. So, here I look at a way to get that.

When ob-ipython executes a cell, it gets two things internally: the output and a list of result elements. The output is all the stuff that is printed, and the result contains result cells. So, we just have to check these for images, and append them to the output in an appropriate way.  I will do that using file links so that org automatically renders them. We will save the images as temp files, since they are regenerated each time you run the cell.

I want output and inline figures. This ipython block should output some text and two figures. Note we do not define file names anywhere! See [[id:44FC1FFF-A6EA-466E-B61C-85B22E58781D][this section]] for details on how to get ob-ipython to do this.

I wrote one new function that writes the base64 data out to a temporary file and returns a link to it. Then, I modified the org-babel-execute:ipython function to append these links onto the output. It seems like you need to use a header like this in your ob-ipython block, notably the results need to be in a drawer like this if you want org-mode to render the images. They do not show up in the results that have colons starting them.

We have made some improvements to using Ipython in org-mode in the past including:

1. [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/29/ob-ipython-and-inline-figures-in-org-mode/][Inline figures]]
2. [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/01/21/Exporting-org-mode-to-Jupyter-notebooks/][Export to Jupyter notebooks]]

Today I will talk about a few new features and improvements I have introduced to scimax for using org-mode and Ipython together.

The video for this post might be more obvious than the post:

** Some convenience functions

There are a few nice shortcuts in the Jupyter notebook. Now we have some convenient commands in scimax to mimic those. My favorites are adding cells above or below the current cell. You can insert a new src block above the current one with (M-x =org-babel-insert-block=). You can use a prefix arg to insert it below the current block.


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
# code
#+END_SRC


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython
# below
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
# some code
#+END_SRC

I am particularly fond of splitting a large block into two smaller blocks. Use (M-x =org-babel-split-src-block=) to do that and leave the point in the upper block. Use a prefix arg to leave the point in the lower block.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
# lots of code in large block
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
# Even more code
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
# The end of the long block
#+END_SRC

You can execute all the blocks up to the current point with (M-x =org-babel-execute-to-point=).

** ob-ipython-inspect works

In the original ob-ipython I found that ob-ipython-inspect did not work unless you were in special edit mode. That is too inconvenient. I modified a few functions to work directly from the org-buffer. I bind this to M-. in org-mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
%matplotlib inline
import numpy as np

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute areas and colors
N = 150
r = 2 * np.random.rand(N)
theta = 2 * np.pi * np.random.rand(N)
area = 200 * r**2
colors = theta

ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar')
c = ax.scatter(theta, r, c=colors, s=area, cmap='hsv', alpha=0.75)

** Getting selective output from Ipython

Out of the box Ipython returns a lot of results. This block, for example returns a plain text, image and latex result as output.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
from sympy import *
# commenting out init_printing() results in no output
init_printing()

var('x y')
x**2 + y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
$$x^{2} + y$$
#+END_EXPORT
:END:


We can select which one we want with a new header argument :ob-ipython-results. For this block you can give it the value of text/plain, text/latex or image/png.


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer :ob-ipython-results text/plain
var('x y')
x**2 + y
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
 2
x  + y
:END:

Or to get the image:


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer :ob-ipython-results image/png
var('x y')
x**2 + y
#+END_SRC

** Where was that error?

A somewhat annoying feature of running cells in org-mode is when there is an exception there has not been a good way to jump to the line that caused the error to edit it. The lines in the src block are not numbered, so in a large block it can be tedious to find the line. In scimax, when you get an exception it will number the lines in the src block, and when you press q in the exception traceback buffer it will jump to the line in the block where the error occurred.

#+NAME: monkey-winner-network-bakerloo
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :results output drawer
print(1)
#raise Exception('Here')
print(2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: monkey-winner-network-bakerloo
:RESULTS:

:END:


If you don't like the numbers add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ob-ipython-number-on-exception nil)
#+END_SRC

** Asynchronous Ipython

I have made a few improvements to the asynchronous workflow in Ipython. We now have a calculation queue, so you can use C-c C-c to execute several blocks in a row, and they will run asynchronously in the order you ran them. While they are running you can continue using Emacs, e.g. writing that paper, reading email, checking RSS feeds, tetris, ... This also lets you run all the blocks up to the current point (M-x =org-babel-execute-ipython-buffer-to-point-async=) or the whole buffer (of Ipython) blocks asynchronously (M-x =org-babel-execute-ipython-buffer-async=).

To turn this on by default put this in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-async-ipython t)
#+END_SRC

This requires all src blocks to have a name, and running the block will give it a name if you have not named the block. By default we use human-readable names. While the block is running, there will be a link indicating it is running. You can click on the link to cancel it. Running subsequent blocks will queue them to be run when the first block is done.

Here is an example:

#+NAME: four-oranges-seventeen-virginia
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output
import time
time.sleep(5)
a = 5
print('done')
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: one-november-mexico-island
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
#raise Exception
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: salami-india-paris-may
#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
print(3 * a)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: salami-india-paris-may
:RESULTS:
15
:END:

Occasionally you will run into an issue. You can clear the queue with elisp:org-babel-async-ipython-clear-queue.


* DONE A Hy macro for defining functions with docstrings on each argument
  CLOSED: [2017-03-19 Sun 19:47]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :categories: hylang,python
  :date:     2017/03/19 19:47:22
  :updated:  2017/03/19 19:53:05
  :END:

For functions with a lot of arguments, python style docstrings leave something to be desired. For one, they are not that close to the arguments, so if you have a function with say 20 arguments, the docstring might take up a whole page! That means they are hard to keep synchronized too. Let's not argue now over the merits of a function with 20+ arguments, it is enough that they exist, and are a problem.

So what are typical documentation standards? Here is a Numpy style doc string:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
def func(arg1, arg2):
    """multiply arg1 and arg2

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg1 : a number
    arg2 : a number

    """
    return arg1 * arg2
#+END_SRC

It works well for a small number of arguments with limited descriptions. This is a proper docstring that is accessible by introspection and pydoc. With much longer argument lists, this falls apart. I will not pick on any code in particular here, but suffice it to say I was inspired today to think of a better way. There are some other documentation solutions at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9195455/how-to-document-a-method-with-parameters, but None of them are better in my opinion. I want accessible docstrings by instrospection, and only if that is unavailable do I want to read the code! Finally, if I have to read the code, I want it to be easy to figure out, which means the documentation is close to the arguments.

There is bad news, I do not have one for vanilla python. Python does not even give you a way to deal with this. But, if we had a lisp, we could make a macro to help us out. In fact, we /have/ a lisp with [[http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/][hy]]! And we can use a macro to make a  syntax that lets us keep the docstring close to the argument, /and/ that constructs a real docstring so we get help later!

Here it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(defmacro mydef [func args &optional docstring &rest body]
  `(defn ~func [~@(map (lambda [x] (nth x 0)) args)]
     ~(+ (if docstring (+ docstring "\n\n") "")
         "Parameters\n----------\n"
         (.join "\n" (map (lambda [x]
                            (.format "{} : {}"
                                     (nth x 0)
                                     (nth x 1))) args)))
     ~@body))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We can checkout how it expands like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(print (macroexpand '(mydef f [(a "an int")
                               (b "an int")]
                            "some doc"
                            (* a b))))
#+END_SRC
#+RESULTS:
: ('setv' 'f' ('fn' ['a' 'b'] 'some d oc\n\nParameters\n----------\na : an int\nb : an int' ('*' 'a' 'b')))

That looks ok. Now, for an example of using that. Here is the same function we defined before, but I put the documentation for each argument with the argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(mydef func ((arg1 "a number")
             (arg2 "a number"))
  "Multiply arg1 by arg2"
  (* arg1 arg2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

We can use the function now like a regular function.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(print (func 24 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 72

And now for the help.

#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-hy
(help func)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Help on function func in module __main__:

func(arg1, arg2)
    Multiply arg1 by arg2

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg1 : a number
    arg2 : a number

#+end_example

Now, that should amaze and astonish you if you are a vanilla Pythonista! We have our cake, and we eat it too. You just can not make up your own syntax that way in Python. Imagine, we could add type information, validation code, etc... into that macro. Maybe it could even be possible to store argument dependent documentation on the function, say in the function dictionary. That would require some conventions I guess,  but they could become introspectable then. For example, in this vanilla Python:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer
def f(x): return x*x
f.__dict__['args'] = {'x': 'A number'}
print(f.__dict__)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
{'args': {'x': 'A number'}}
:END:

In the end, this does not really solve all the problems I have with current docstrings in Python. It does solve a problem with writing and reading the code by keeping documentation close to the arguments, but ultimately the docstring from Python's point of view will basically look the same. It is pretty awesome that it is even possible. Hy lisp for the win here (again!).

  :END:

I have been thinking of better ways to write code that is more likely to have decent docstrings that are up to date, and maybe that enable automatic validation. One strategy is to keep documentation and code together, and by together I mean /close together/. The closer the better.  I made some interesting progress in the [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2017/03/19/A-Hy-macro-for-defining-functions-with-docstrings-on-each-argument/][last post]], where I used a macro to let me put argument specific documentation in the same place that the argument is defined. Here I expand the idea to also provide argument default values, and validation code where the argument is defined inside the function, in addition to generating docstrings. This post is written in Emacs-lisp, mostly because I am more familiar with the macro language. The idea should apply to other lisps too.

Let's consider this prototypical, vanilla function definition, usage, and docstring.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun f1 (arg1 arg2)
  "Add two numbers."
  (+ arg1 arg2))

;; usage
(f1 3 4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 7

Here is what the help looks like from emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(describe-function 'f1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: f1 is a Lisp function.
:
: (f1 ARG1 ARG2)
:
: For more information check the manuals.
:
: Add two numbers.

It is clear I was lazy in writing the docstring; it does not even mention the arguments. There is also no validation of the arguments so if you pass a string and a number, you will get an error. There are no defaults either, so you have to provide both arguments. It seems like there could be significant room for improvement. Of course, I could bite the bullet and write a better function like this one:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun f1a (arg1 &optional arg2)
  "Add ARG1 and ARG2 together.
ARG1 and  ARG2 should both be numbers."
  (when (null arg2) (setq arg2 2))
  (unless (and (numberp arg1) (numberp arg2)) (error "arg1 and arg2 should both be numbers"))
  (+ arg1 arg2))

(list (f1a 3 4) (f1a 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 7 | 5 |

Yes, I could do that, but it is tedious to do it all the time. And it still leaves something to be desired for me. The docstring does not say what the default value is for example, and that is hard-coded in the code, i.e. not introspectible until you look at the code.  Next we consider an alternative way to write the function. Compare that to this function definition, usage and documentation. The function definition is a little more verbose. Providing documentation, defaults and validation code in any form would make it that way no matter what.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defn f2 ((arg1 "A number" :validate numberp)
	  (arg2 "A number" :validate numberp :default 2))
  "Add the arguments."
  (+ arg1 arg2))

: For more information check the manuals.
:
: Add the arguments.
: ARG1 : A number (valid = numberp)
: ARG2 : A number (default = 2) (valid = numberp)

The documentation is built up from the information in the function definition, in a form that is mostly consistent with emacs-lisp documentation standards. =defn= is not a regular emacs-lisp function; it is a macro I developed to generate the function code. It turned out to be long, but the gist of it is that before defining the function I loop through the arguments and collect the docstrings, along with any information about default values and/or validation functions. Then I build up the list of arguments to put in the function. Then if any default values are set, I generate some code to set those values if they are not set in the function call, and finally a similar block of validation code. At the end, I construct the defun and return it. You can check out the code if you want here: https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/scimax-macros.el.

Let's take a look at what this code expands to.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results code
(macroexpand-1
 '(defn f2 ((arg1 "A number" :validate numberp)
	    (arg2 "A number" :validate numberp :default 2))
    "Add the arguments."
    (+ arg1 arg2)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun f2
    (arg1 &optional arg2)
  "Add the arguments.\nARG1 : A number (valid = numberp)\nARG2 : A number (default = 2) (valid = numberp)\n"
  (progn
    (when
	(null arg2)
      (setq arg2 2)))
  (progn
    (unless
	(funcall 'numberp arg1)
      (error "In (%s %s) Expected %s to pass %S. Got %S" "f2" "(arg1 &optional arg2)" "arg1" 'numberp arg1))
    (unless
	(funcall 'numberp arg2)
      (error "In (%s %s) Expected %s to pass %S. Got %S" "f2" "(arg1 &optional arg2)" "arg2" 'numberp arg2)))
  (+ arg1 arg2))
#+END_SRC

You can see it expands to a regular defun, with a generated docstring, generated default settings code block, and generated validation code. Pretty nice.

Let's see what happens with a function that fails the validation. We should get an error. Here we capture the error so we can see it in the post.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(condition-case err
    (f2 "oak")
  (error
   (error-message-string err)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: In (f2 (arg1 &optional arg2)) Expected arg1 to pass numberp. Got "oak"

So we even get a useful error message when the wrong type of argument is provided. Compare that to the error message from the original version of this function. It tells us we got the wrong type, but not which argument.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(condition-case err
    (f1 "oak" 4)
  (error
   (error-message-string err)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Wrong type argument: number-or-marker-p, "oak"

One last example to check out the &rest argument, with validation that every arg is a number.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defn f4 ((rarg :rest
		:validate (lambda (x)
			    (-all-p 'identity (mapcar 'numberp x)))))
  "multiply all the arguments."
  (apply '* rarg))

(f4 1 2 3)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 6

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(condition-case err
    (f4 "oak" 4)
  (error
   (error-message-string err)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: In (f4 (&rest rarg)) Expected rarg to pass (lambda (x) (-all-p (quote identity) (mapcar (quote numberp) x))). Got ("oak" 4)

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(describe-function 'f4)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: f4 is a Lisp function.
:
: (f4 &rest RARG)
:
: For more information check the manuals.
:
: multiply all the arguments.
: RARG : No documentation

That looks ok too.

** Summary

The motivation for this was to help me write better code with better documentation. Better code in the sense that it can provide run-time validation, with better feedback, and automatic documentation, including that there is none if that is the case. It is basically compatible with the regular defun, but enhances what kind of documentation is possible with less work on my part. I think it will make it easier to keep documentation in sync, since the argument documentation would be kept near the argument, and you can build in validation if you want to.

It is no news to lispers that macros are good for this kind of application.
* DONE A better return in org-mode

Over on [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24574/org-mode-default-to-alt-enter-for-bullets][Stackoverflow]] someone wanted a better return in org-mode. They wanted return to add items in a list (instead of M-Ret). Someone posted a partial solution, and here I improve on it to add new items to lists, new headings after a heading, and new rows to tables. In each case, a double return on an empty item, headline or table row will delete that line, and terminate the list, headlines or table. You can still use M-Ret, and this function falls through to org-return like it did before. You can use a prefix arg to get a regular return if you want one (e.g. you want to press enter on a headline to push it down).

Here is the function. Give it a try. It is a small but helpful addition I think. I have not used it for long, so if you come across issues leave a comment!

* DONE Autoformatting ordinal numbers and fractions in orgmode

  :END:

MS Word has a /few/ things I like. One of them is the ability to autoformat things to make an ordinal number string like 1st to the superscripted version 1^{st} while you type or a 1/2 to ½.  I thought it would be pretty easy to implement that for org-mode. It turns out it was not so easy!

There does not appear to be a way to specify a regexp pattern as an abbreviation, or an abbrev that starts with a number. What we need for ordinal numbers is to recognize a sequence of numbers followed by "st", "nd", "rd" or "th" followed by a space or punctuation, and then superscript the letters. In case you didn't want the replacement to occur, you should be able to undo it and get back the original string. This addition was a little hard won, so I am sharing the lessons here.

The logic I used is to put a function in the post-self-insert-hook. The function only works in org-mode, when not in a codeblock and when looking back at a regexp that matches a pattern to be replaced. Getting it to undo was trickier than expected. Eventually I worked out that you put an undo boundary in place before the change, and then it seems like you can undo the changes. I created a minor mode so it is easy to toggle this on and off.

Here is the implementation:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (save-excursion

  :END:

Emacs lisp has a few data structures that store key-value pairs. Here are some canonical examples of these data structures and the way to get data out of them.

- a-lists

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((data '((key1 . 4)
	      (key2 . "tree"))))
  (cdr (assoc 'key2 data)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: tree

- p-lists

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((data '(:key1 4 :key2 "tree")))
  (plist-get data :key2))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: tree

- A hash table

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((data #s(hash-table data (key1 4 key2 "tree"))))
  (gethash 'key2 data))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: tree

Each of these uses some function to get data out of them. I have been learning about closures today, and realized a way you can make a "callable" data structure using them. In a closure, the data is stored as part of a function. We will use a [[http://letoverlambda.com]["let over lambda"]] with a defalias in a lexical environment to achieve this. I will wrap a p-list with this approach, but it could work with any of the examples above. We will make the function have a few behaviors that allow us to see the whole data structure with no args, to get a value with one arg that is a key, and to set a value if there are more than two args add them as key-val pairs to the data structure. This block binds the function to the symbol "d" which is then a callable function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :lexical t
(let ((data '(:key1 4 :key2 "tree")))
  (defalias 'd
    (lambda (&rest key-vals)
      (cond
       ;; no args, return data
       ((= 0 (length key-vals))
	data)
       ;; just a key, get val
       ((= 1 (length key-vals))
	(plist-get data (car key-vals)))
       (t
	(loop for key in (-slice key-vals 0 nil 2)
	      for val in (-slice key-vals 1 nil 2)
	      do
	      (plist-put data key val))
	data)))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: d

Now we can use it like to get some data out:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d :key2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: tree

And add new values like:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d :key3 "oak")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| :key1 | 4 | :key2 | tree | :key3 | oak |

You can update a value with this too:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d :key3 "pine")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| :key1 | 4 | :key2 | tree | :key3 | pine |

or add multiple values like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d :key4 0 :key5 9)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| :key1 | 4 | :key2 | tree | :key3 | pine | :key4 | 0 | :key5 | 9 |

And see the whole plist with no args:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| :key1 | 4 | :key2 | tree | :key3 | pine | :key4 | 0 | :key5 | 9 |

Pretty nice! It seems like there ought to be a macro to facilitate creating those. Here is one.
This macro basically expands to the same code as above, but for fun I add a default value option.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :lexical t
(defmacro default-dict (var &optional default &rest key-vals)
  "Bind a callable plist to VAR that contains KEY-VALS."
  (let ()
    `(let ((data ',key-vals))
       (defalias ',var
	 (lambda (&rest key-vals)
	   (message "%s" key-vals)
	   (cond
	    ;; no args, return data
	    ((= 0 (length key-vals))
	     data)
	    ;; just a key, get val
	    ((= 1 (length key-vals))
	     (or  (plist-get data (car key-vals)) ,default))
	    (t
	     (loop for key in (-slice key-vals 0 nil 2)
		   for val in (-slice key-vals 1 nil 2)
		   do
		   (plist-put data key val))
	     data)))))))
#+END_SRC

Here is an instance of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(default-dict d2 "None" :key1 4 :key2 "tree")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: d2

And here it is in use.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d2 :key1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 4

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(d2 :new-key)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: None

Not bad. If you come from Python, you might find this style of data structure to be more similar to what you are used to seeing. It sure seems less verbose than the usual plist boilerplate I have used before.

** An update <2017-04-21 Fri>

One (perhaps undesirable even) feature of the approach above is that it creates a function in the global namespace. This might have unintended consequences with name clashes or shadowing, and if you later use the same variable name for a plist, you would change the function behavior. Here we consider a way to limit the scope of where these functions exist and work. The labels macro provides one way to do this, we just create temporary functions that only exist within a scope. There is a lot of backticking and comma operators in this, and it took quite a few iterations to get it working!

This macro creates temporary functions for each keyword that return the value in the plist.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :lexical t
(defmacro with-dict (key-vals &rest body)
  "A context-manager for a plist where each key is a callable
function that returns the value."
  (declare (indent 1))
  (let* ((g (if (symbolp key-vals)
		(symbol-value key-vals)
	      key-vals))
	 (keys (-slice g 0 nil 2)))
    `(labels ,(loop for key in keys
		    collect
		    (list key '() `(plist-get ',g  ,key)))
       ,@body)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: with-dict

Here is how we use it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-dict (:a 1 :b 'some-symbol :c 3)
  (:b))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| quote | some-symbol |

We can also use it with variables that hold mappings like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((d '(:key1 1 :key2 some-other-symbol :key3 3)))
  (with-dict d
    (format "We got %s" (:key2))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: We got some-other-symbol

That is pretty interesting! In case that looks similar to a context manager in Python, now you know where Python got that idea ;)

Another related idea is to let-bind the values to variables within a scope. We can't use the keywords directly here, so I use some hackery to strip off the colon so it is a regular symbol. That is not quite as nice I guess since you have to remember to remove the : from the symbols in the body of your code.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defmacro with-plist-vals (plist &rest body)
  "Bind the values of a plist to variables with the name of the keys."
  (declare (indent 1))
  `(let ,(loop for key in (-slice plist 0 nil 2)
	       for val in (-slice plist 1 nil 2)
	       collect (list (intern
			      (substring (symbol-name key) 1))
			     val))
     ,@body))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: with-plist-vals

Here is an example usage.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(with-plist-vals (:a 4 :b 6)
 (* 2 a))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8

Obviously that is just an alternate syntax for the let statement, but it lets you leverage the plist syntax for multiple purposes.
* Superpowered email in Emacs

Gmail does a few things right: awesome search, email completion. I am not a big fan of writing email in a browser though. You know, because I like editing text in Emacs.

I treat email primarily as an inbox of messages I need to do something with. My preference is to read an email, and either respond and archive, archive or delete it. If I can not do one of those things, the email should go on a todo list for me to handle later. If a message is in the inbox, it means it is waiting for me to do something. I try to keep under 50 emails in my inbox at any given time, and those are emails I usually plan to handle within a few days (or it goes on a todo list).

** TODO Attachment reminder
** Highlight some words from specific users

I get some automated reports from a computer cluster. These reports tell me if the RAID array is in Optimal, Degraded or Missing status. To make it easier to read these, I want those words to be highlighted in color. I especially want words like Degraded and Missing to be red so they stand out! This snippet highlights those words, but only in emails from the cluster. This is an example of conditionally changing the appearance of an email.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results silent
(defun gilgamesh-fontify ()
  (loop for (name . email) in (mu4e-message-field-at-point :from)
	do
	(when (string= email "root@gilgamesh.cheme.cmu.edu")
	  (hi-lock-mode 1)
	  (highlight-regexp "Optimal" 'mu4e-modeline-face) ; a greenish color
	  (highlight-regexp "Degraded" 'mu4e-warning-face) ; a reddish color
	  (highlight-regexp "Missing" 'mu4e-warning-face))))

#+END_SRC

** Mail merge

Many times I collect information from people by email. I like to send individual emails, rather than one email to the whole group. It makes it simpler for me to aggregate the data they send me, and I get individual email threads. If the information is sufficiently structured, it is easy to use the mail-merge feature of scimax to generate and send the emails.

Mail merge is a multi-step process

1. Create a data source (usually a table) that has all the information you need. Each row in the table will end up being one email. Give the table a name, so it can be the input for a source block later.

#+name: mail-merge-data
| email              | first name | last name | file       |
|--------------------+------------+-----------+------------|
| some@person.com    | Some       | One       | tees.org   |
| another@person.com | Another    | Person    | shorts.org |

2. Create a template using ${identifier} tags that will be replaced by things in the template by data from the data-source using s-format. I like to put these in a named example block like this so it is easy to include in a source block later. This block uses a personal name to address the person, tells them to check on a file, and attaches the file to the email. Note this also puts an id link in the message. If they reply, and that link is there, I can type C-c o on it and jump back to the heading where I sent the message from. I might copy some data from the message there.

#+name: email-template
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Dear ${NAME},

Please check this file: ${FILE}. It is attached.

-----------------------
Please do not delete this.
[[id:${ID}]]

<#part type="application/octet-stream" filename="${PATH}" disposition=attachment>
<#/part>
#+END_EXAMPLE

3. Generate the messages using `mail-merge-make-headings'. You need to create a new data-source that defines the fields in the template, and the heading properties TO and SUBJECT. This will generate a subheading called Messages in the current heading. Each message will be a subsubheading, and initially tagged :unsent:.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=mail-merge-data template=email-template
(let ((data-source (loop for (email fname lname file) in data
			 collect
			 `(("TO" . ,email)
			   ("SUBJECT" . ,(format "Meeting notes about %s" file))
			   ("HEADLINE" . ,(format "Message to %s %s" fname lname))
			   ("NAME" . ,fname)
			   ("FILE" . ,file)
			   ("PATH" . ,(expand-file-name file))))))
  (mail-merge-make-headings template data-source)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

4. Inspect each message. You can edit these messages by hand, or modify the template/code above and re-run them. If a message is good, send it with M-x mail-merge-send-heading (which opens a message buffer and you have to C-c C-c to send it). I always do this for the first few to make sure the messages are formatted correctly. Once I am sure of that, C-u M-x mail-merge-send-heading will send the message directly. Both tag the message as sent, and add some properties about when the message was sent, stores a link to the sent message, and  move the point to the next unsent message. I actually use speed keys for this. When you are on the first star of the message headline, pressing m will open the message buffer for you to send, and pressing s will just send it. If you are super confident, you can use M-x mail-merge and it will send all headlines that are tagged unsent with a TO property with a 0.2 second delay.

** Triggering followup actions on replies

A sent message has a message-id and when people reply to it, that id should be in a references header field. We can set up a hook that alerts us when someone replies to a specific email. This will be triggered on every view, so you might be careful about what the action does.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq email-notifications '(("m28tqmhobn.fsf@Johns-MacBook-Air.local" . (message-box "Followup!"))))

	do
	(message "%s: %S against %S"
		 (-contains? (mu4e-message-field-at-point :references) ref)
		 ref (mu4e-message-field-at-point :references))
	(when (-contains? (mu4e-message-field-at-point :references) ref)
	  (message "confirmed")

It is pretty slow though. I have not profiled it, but I guess it is slow because we have to get the data, then map over it to create the candidates. Maybe it would be better to store the strings and just retrieve them.

As a reminder to myself, I did this for the following reasons:

1. To get full text search. It appears it was not going to be easy to achieve that with the emacsql/sqlite version I made before. But, that version is a lot faster at generating candidates so far.

2. To get a different query syntax. Mongo basically uses json to build the query. This is easier to programatically generate queries. emacsql is also not too bad, but I found some limitations on the mapping of sql to elisp.

3. To get more flexible document structure. With Mongo, it is easy to add new things, and it is not necessary to define new tables and columns.

We examine historical publication counts for these departments. We also do a detailed analysis of the trends for the 2014 journal publications for each department. We consider how many articles were published, how many times they were cited, where they were published, and who published them. We examine trends in these metrics and their correlation with rankings. We construct a \"j-index\" for each department, which is analogous to an h-index, but applies only to the publications of 2014, and their citations as of approximately March of 2015. The goal of this analysis is to benchmark our metrics with those of the top 20.\n\nBefore getting into the detailed analysis, we refer to the \"Leiden manifesto for research metrics\"  SOcite:hicks-2015-bibliom. This document lays out 10 principles to guide research evaluation. We review these here.\n1. Quantitative evaluation should support qualitative, expert assessment.\n  These metrics are only numbers, but they can provide evidence to support our assessments, and evidence that any actions we decide to take are effective. We should not be seduced into chasing a single metric.\n2. Measure performance against the research missions of the institution, group or researcher.\n3. Protect excellence in locally relevant research.\n4. Keep data collection and analytical processes open, transparent and simple.\n5. Allow those evaluated to verify data and analysis.\n6. Account for variation by field in publication and citation practices.\n  This is a particularly valid point for this study. Some departments are dominated by different fields, and these fields have different top journals, different citation practices, and different amounts and types of funding available.\n7. Base assessment of individual researchers on a qualitative judgement of their portfolio\n8. Avoid misplaced concreteness and false precision\n9. Recognize the systemic effects of assessment and indicators\n10. Scrutinize indicators regularly and update them\n\n" }

* TODO An update on Matlab in org-mode

this is not working unfortunately. The notebook itself works fine. Just this does not work with ob-ipython. I seem to get a timeout error.

In the past Matlab integration with org-mode has been spotty, and not useful on Windows. That may have changed recently. Starting around Matlab2014 there

Second, there is now a [[https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel][Jupyter kernel for Matlab]]. When coupled with [[https://github.com/gregsexton/ob-ipython][ob-ipython]] and some "light" configuration, we can run Matlab inside org-mode, and even export a Jupyter Matlab notebook!

So first the configuration. You need a pretty recent version of Matlab, it looks like at least 2014. I am using 2016b here. You have to install the Matlab Engine API for Python (https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html). It is pretty easy, and involves changing to a directory in your Matlab installation and running "python install setup.py".

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd /Applications/MATLAB_R2016b.app/extern/engines/python
python install setup.py
#+END_SRC

Next install the Jupyter kernel. This is also pretty simple:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install matlab_kernel
python -m matlab_kernel install
#+END_SRC

On the Emacs side I use this to leverage ob-ipython with some default headers:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-src-lang-modes '("jupyter-matlab" . matlab))
(add-to-list 'org-latex-minted-langs '(jupyter-matlab  "matlab"))

;; set default headers for convenience
(setq org-babel-default-header-args:jupyter-matlab
      '((:results . "output replace")
	(:session . "matlab")
	(:kernel . "matlab")
	(:exports . "code")
	(:cache .   "no")
	(:noweb . "no")
	(:hlines . "no")
	(:tangle . "no")))

(defalias 'org-babel-execute:jupyter-matlab 'org-babel-execute:ipython)
(defalias 'org-babel-prep-session:jupyter-matlab 'org-babel-prep-session:ipython)
(defalias 'org-babel-jupyter-matlab-initiate-session 'org-babel-ipython-initiate-session)

	     '("jm" "#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-matlab\n?\n#+END_SRC"

I do not see a great search tool here that does not involve linear search. One solution seems to be coupled to postgresql http://www.newtdb.org/en/latest/how-it-works.html.

* A spell-check buffer buffer

Spell-checking in Emacs is a one place that could use some UI work. I use flyspell which alerts me to misspellings as I type, and I have C-; bound to flyspell-correct-previous-word-generic which makes it easy to correct the last word, and I use flyspell-ivy-correct to do that. This works OK for me while writing, but it fails pretty miserably in the following scenario:

I have a long document, e.g. a proposal, or a manuscript someone has sent me and I want to spell-check it. Sure, I can run flyspell-buffer, got back to the beginning, and navigate through it with C-, (flyspell-goto-next-error), but then I still have to go through the document to check the errors, and every time I fix an error, it seems like the rest of them disappear. I consider that a bug.

What I want instead is a new buffer listing all the things tagged by flyspell as clickable links I could review and correct.

Someone asked on the ASE mailing list how to get a custom sorted atoms object. It seems the default is just in alphabetical order. Also, it seems that sorting an atoms object creates a list, which is not an atoms object at all. The key to sorting an atoms object is to get a list of indices in the order you want the atoms, and then use that to sort the atoms.

* Jump around, jump around, jump up, jump up and get down

Navigation in Emacs does not have to be a House of Pain. Here we consider how to "jump" around, which means we do not use the arrows or character navigation commands to move our cursor to the place we want it. When you know what you want, this can be a very fast way to get around in Emacs.

** Org-mode navigation

I use a variety of functions to jump around to headings in org-files. I think of this is a variety of scopes, e.g. what is visible, what is in a file, what is in a directory, what is in a project, what is open in Emacs, what is in my agenda files, and what is on my hard drive.

These functions help me jump quickly to a heading in one of those scopes.

- ivy-org-jump-to-visible-headline :: jump to a visible heading using avy
- ivy-org-jump-to-heading :: jump to a heading in the current buffer
- ivy-org-jump-to-heading-in-directory :: jump to a heading in an org file in the current directory
- ivy-org-jump-to-project-headline :: jump to a heading in an org file in the current project
- ivy-org-jump-to-agenda-heading :: Jump to a heading in an agenda file
- ivy-org-jump-to-open-headline :: Jump to a heading in an open buffer
- org-db-open-heading :: jump to a heading using org-db

Here are some aliases that make it a little speedier to use them.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'iojv 'ivy-org-jump-to-visible-headline)
(defalias 'iojh 'ivy-org-jump-to-heading)
(defalias 'iojd 'ivy-org-jump-to-heading-in-directory)
(defalias 'iojp 'ivy-org-jump-to-project-headline)
(defalias 'iojo 'ivy-org-jump-to-open-headline)
(defalias 'ioja 'ivy-org-jump-to-agenda-heading)
(defalias 'iojd 'org-db-open-heading)
#+END_SRC

Another context for headlines are my contacts. I keep these in org-files, with each contact as a headline. I can access them with the commands above, but if I know I want a contact, I use this command

- ivy-contacts :: ivy selection for contacts

which provides several actions including open the entry as well as inserting information about the contact, e.g. their email address.
** Jump to a buffer

- ivy-switch-buffer :: jump to a buffer with ivy selection

** Project navigation

Sometimes you might prefer to open a "project". A project is any directory that is a git repo or any directory that has a .projectile file in it. [[http://projectile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][projectile]] makes it pretty easy to jump around between these.

Here are the most useful navigation commands:

- projectile-switch-project :: use completion to select a known project, and then a file in the project.

If you happen to know the project is already open you will get fewer candidates with this command

- projectile-switch-open-project :: switch to an open project

You can switch to a file in the project with

- projectile-find-file :: Open a file in the project

You can find files containing patterns in a project using these commands. They just use different commands (grep and ag) for searching through project files. They are useful to limit the scope of searching to project files.

- helm-projectile-grep
- helm-projectile-ag

** Recent files

You may want to reopen a recently opened file. I use the recentf package, and helm-recentf (you might also like counsel-recentf) to acces a list of these.

** Bookmarks

* Scimax is awesome

elisp:emacs-keybinding-command-tooltip-mode

** Scimax-hydras

I don't always remember all the key bindings, and I frequently get tired of chording keys, e.g. M-x C-x etc... I created a large set of hydras to help with this. I bind the hydra to f12, and remap my caps lock key to f12. Then, I can press it with my pinky, and from there many things are a few key-presses away. For example, <f12 ret> saves the buffer. <f12 b k> kills the current buffer. <f12 /> will undo the last action. <f12 x cmd> is equivalent to <M-x cmd>. Each key in the f12 hydra launches another hydra, e.g. one to open applications, one for navigation, bookmarks, search, etc...

** Ipython
** Contacts
** org-ref

** ov-highlights

If you have ever wanted to annotate an org-file without changing it, ov-highlight might be for you. You can highlight text, change it to bold, italic, strikeout, underline, put it in boxes, or make it larger or smaller. You can change the font. As well as leave notes for yourself. These annotations are persistent and will reappear when you reopen the file!

** ox-clip

It is true, sometimes you have to work with software that is not Emacs+org-mode... Scimax helps a little by making it possible to copy org-mode in rich text/html format that can be pasted into MS-Word and most browsers. You can copy formatting with =ox-clip-formatted-copy= (e.g. *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_ and +strike+, H_{2}O and H^{+}) equations, tables and code blocks. Images do not currently copy (at least on a Mac due to limitations of the command line utility used for the copy). It is not perfect, but it goes a long way to bridging the gap!

\(y = x^2 - x + 3\)

| x | y |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 9 |

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
#+END_SRC

As an alternative, try =ox-rtf-formatted-copy=. It is not perfect either, but it does copy images.
** Email
** RSS

Scimax is setup to run elfeed out of the box. It is setup to follow some Python and Emacs feeds.

I added a few new features. On an entry you can press "e" to email it to someone. If there is a doi in the entry, press "d" to add the entry to your bibtex file. To capture the entry for reading later, press "c".

I get a lot of entries, so you can press "f" and "j" to mark an entry as read. Finally, press "o" to open it.

You can also store a link to an entry (usually C-c l) for use in org-mode.
