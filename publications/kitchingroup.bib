  abstract =     "In the current scientific publishing landscape, there is a
                  need for an authoring workflow that easily integrates data and
                  code into manuscripts and that enables the data and code to be
                  published in reusable form. Automated embedding of data and
                  code into published output will enable superior communication
                  and data archiving. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of
                  concept for a workflow, org-mode, which successfully provides
                  this authoring capability and workflow integration. We
                  illustrate this concept in a series of examples for potential
                  uses of this workflow. First, we use data on citation counts
                  to compute the h-index of an author, and show two code
                  examples for calculating the h-index. The source for each
                  example is automatically embedded in the PDF during the export
                  of the document. We demonstrate how data can be embedded in
                  image files, which themselves are embedded in the document.
                  Finally, metadata about the embedded files can be
                  automatically included in the exported PDF, and accessed by
                  computer programs. In our customized export, we embedded
                  metadata about the attached files in the PDF in an Info field.
                  A computer program could parse this output to get a list of
                  embedded files and carry out analyses on them. Authoring tools
                  such as Emacs + org-mode can greatly facilitate the
                  integration of data and code into technical writing. These
                  tools can also automate the embedding of data into document
                  formats intended for consumption.",

                  structures and these chiral surfaces can potentially be used

                  surfaces with additional metal atoms is one potential avenue
                  for improving the enantiospecificity of these surfaces. For a
                  successful step decoration, the additional metal atoms should
                  ideally remain at the kinked step sites on the surface. We
                  performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
                  identify pairs of metal adatoms and metal surfaces where this
                  kind of step decoration could be thermodynamically
                  stable. These calculations have identified multiple stable
                  examples of step decoration.  Using our DFT results, we
                  developed a model to predict surface segregation on a wide
                  range of stepped metal surfaces. With this model, we have
                  estimated the stability of step decoration without further DFT
                  calculations for surface segregation for all combinations of
                  the 3d, 4d, and 5d metals.},

                  surface were constructed as a function of the corresponding
                  chemical potential which showed sulfur poisoning occurs even
                  at ppm levels of H2S in the environment at low
                  temperatures. Under reaction conditions relevant to WGS at low
                  temperature, CO and S adsorbed surface structures were found
                  to be more stable then the clean catalyst surfaces. At high
                  temperatures and high hydrogen pressures, a poisoned surface
                  can be regenerated back to a clean surface. The shapes of a Cu
                  nanoparticle in the WGS reaction conditions under various
                  sulfur chemical potentials were determined using the Wulff
                  construction. We found that the crystal shape changes
                  significantly from one dominated by (111) and (100) facets at
                  very low sulfur chemical potentials to a shape dominated by
                  (110) facets at higher sulfur chemical potentials, suggesting
                  that reactive site distributions may change under reaction
                  conditions.  (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract =	 {The adsorption energy of an adsorbate can depend strongly on
                  its coverage.  We present density-functional calculations of
                  the adsorption energy of C, N, and O on the fcc sites of
                  Pd(111) at coverages from 0.2 to 1 ML. The adsorption energy
                  generally increases (gets weaker) with coverage in a near
                  linear fashion for the most stable configurations.  We
                  observed a practically constant d-band filling at all
                  coverages and interpret the coverage dependence in terms of a
                  simple d-band model where the d band is broadened and lowered
                  in energy by the interaction with the adsorbates. We find the
                  Pd(111) d-band center is approximately linearly correlated
                  with the coverage of each adsorbate.  A consequence of this
                  electronic structure-coverage correlation for each adsorbate
                  is that the adsorption energies of each adsorbate
                  configuration are strongly correlated with each other. All of
                  the exceptions to these correlations can be traced to surface
                  reconstruction or adsorbate configurations that are not
                  geometrically similar to adsorption in the fcc hollow
                  sites. Finally, we show that all the coverage-dependent
                  adsorption energies can be collapsed into a single
                  configurational correlation by scaling of the adsorption
                  energies.},

                  was used to separate oxygen and to concentrate carbon dioxide
                  from a mixed gaseous stream. Carbon dioxide concentration was
                  achieved from a gaseous stream composed of 49.3\% carbon
                  dioxide and 50.7\% oxygen.  A volumetric ratio of 3.56:1
                  carbon dioxide to oxygen evolution was observed. Oxygen
                  separation occurs through reversible oxygen reduction and
                  oxygen evolution reactions. Carbon dioxide separation occurs
                  through homogeneous reactions between gas-phase CO2 and
                  electrochemical reaction products on one side of the membrane
                  to form carbonate and bicarbonate ions and neutralization of
                  those ions on the other side of the membrane by
                  electrochemical reactions. Current densities reached a maximum
                  of 6 mA/cm(2) at a cell potential of 1.2 V. Although this
                  approach is not efficient enough to utilize for CO2 capture
                  for fossil energy applications at this time, more active
                  electrocatalysts and thinner ion-exchange membranes could
                  improve the efficiency in the future, and it may be suitable
                  for other applications such as removal of CO2 from breathing
                  air. (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.  [Doi:

                  studies. Using a linear four-point probe (FPP), we
                  investigated the effects of surface stoichiometry and of
                  exposure to oxygen on the surface resistivity. We also
                  investigated the effect of palladium (Pd) particles of varying
                  sizes on the surface resistivity using both FPP and scanning
                  tunneling microscopy. Our results showed that there was a
                  strong dependence of the resistivity on the average Ti
                  oxidation state of the clean TiO2 (0 0 1) surface.  A decrease
                  in the surface resistivity of TiO2 (0 0 1) was observed after
                  the surface was reduced by Ar+ ion sputtering, whereas an
                  increase in the resistivity of the sputtered-TiO2 surface was

                  intermediates of electrochemical processes on the basis of
                  electronic structure calculations. We used that method in
                  combination with detailed density functional calculations to
                  develop a detailed description of the free-energy landscape of
                  the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction over Pt(111) as
                  a function of applied bias. This allowed us to identify the
                  origin of the overpotential found for this reaction. Adsorbed
                  oxygen and hydroxyl are found to be very stable intermediates
                  at potentials close to equilibrium, and the calculated rate
                  constant for the activated proton/electron transfer to
                  adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl can account quantitatively for the
                  observed kinetics. On the basis of a database of calculated
                  oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption energies, the trends in the
                  oxygen reduction rate for a large number of different
                  transition and noble metals can be accounted for. Alternative
                  reaction mechanisms involving proton/electron transfer to
                  adsorbed molecular oxygen were also considered, and this
                  peroxide mechanism was found to dominate for the most noble
                  metals. The model suggests ways to improve the
                  electrocatalytic properties of fuel-cell cathodes.},

                  and geometric structure of tip atoms in scanning tunneling
                  microscopy (STM). This work reports the performance of a
                  heteropolyacid (HPA)-functionalized Pt/Ir tip, which was
                  formulated by contacting a mechanically formed tip with a
                  solution of H3PW12O40 molecules. Attachment of an H3PW12O40
                  molecule on the metal tip was confirmed by observing the
                  characteristic negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior
                  of H3PW12O40 in tunneling spectroscopy. Atomic resolution
                  images of bare graphite as well as of H6P2W18O62 HPA
                  monolayers on graphite were successfully obtained with a
                  Pt/Ir-HPA tip. In the H3PW12O40 molecule on a metal tip, it is
                  likely that a terminal oxygen of W=O (an oxygen species
                  projecting outward from the pseudospherical H3PW12O40
                  molecule) serves as an atomically sharp and stable tip.
                  Additionally, superimposed superperiodic structures
                  commensurate with the underlying graphite lattice were
                  regularly observed with the modified tips. This result
                  suggests that tip functionalization with these metal oxide
                  molecules may enhance resolution in a fashion analogous to
                  functionalization with C-60.},
