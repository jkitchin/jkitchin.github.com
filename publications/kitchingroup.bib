                  structures and these chiral surfaces can potentially be used

                  surfaces with additional metal atoms is one potential avenue
                  for improving the enantiospecificity of these surfaces. For a
                  successful step decoration, the additional metal atoms should

                  reactive environment of H-2, H2S. H2O and CO. An atomistic
                  thermodynamic framework based on DFT was used for describing
                  the phase behaviors of the adsorbates on different Cu
                  facets. Phase diagrams of each possible adsorbate on each
                  surface were constructed as a function of the corresponding
                  chemical potential which showed sulfur poisoning occurs even
                  at ppm levels of H2S in the environment at low

                  an adsorbate-induced surface electronic structure modification

                  alloy surfaces.  The estimated properties were validated by
                  DFT calculations for 110 of the surface structures. We then
                  utilized an atomistic thermodynamic framework that includes

                  sulfur-tolerant Cu-based catalysts and compare the results

                  and XPS results indicated that Ni atoms deposited at 300 K

                  of Ni atoms diffuse into the bulk in the course of annealing

                  Pd(111) at coverages from 0.2 to 1 ML. The adsorption energy
                  generally increases (gets weaker) with coverage in a near
                  linear fashion for the most stable configurations.  We
                  observed a practically constant d-band filling at all

                  simple d-band model where the d band is broadened and lowered

                  studies. Using a linear four-point probe (FPP), we
                  investigated the effects of surface stoichiometry and of
                  exposure to oxygen on the surface resistivity. We also
                  investigated the effect of palladium (Pd) particles of varying
                  sizes on the surface resistivity using both FPP and scanning
                  tunneling microscopy. Our results showed that there was a
                  strong dependence of the resistivity on the average Ti
                  oxidation state of the clean TiO2 (0 0 1) surface.  A decrease
                  in the surface resistivity of TiO2 (0 0 1) was observed after
                  the surface was reduced by Ar+ ion sputtering, whereas an
                  increase in the resistivity of the sputtered-TiO2 surface was
                  detected after reacting with gas-phase oxygen. In addition, we
                  found that the presence of Pd particles enhanced the sensing
                  performance to oxygen, and that the degree of enhancement
                  depended strongly on the size of the Pd nanoparticles. (C)

                  intermediates of electrochemical processes on the basis of
                  electronic structure calculations. We used that method in
                  combination with detailed density functional calculations to
                  develop a detailed description of the free-energy landscape of
                  the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction over Pt(111) as
                  a function of applied bias. This allowed us to identify the
                  origin of the overpotential found for this reaction. Adsorbed
                  oxygen and hydroxyl are found to be very stable intermediates
                  at potentials close to equilibrium, and the calculated rate
                  constant for the activated proton/electron transfer to
                  adsorbed oxygen or hydroxyl can account quantitatively for the
                  observed kinetics. On the basis of a database of calculated
                  oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption energies, the trends in the
                  oxygen reduction rate for a large number of different

                  peroxide mechanism was found to dominate for the most noble

                  demonstrate the potential of controlling the chemical identity
                  and geometric structure of tip atoms in scanning tunneling
                  microscopy (STM). This work reports the performance of a
                  heteropolyacid (HPA)-functionalized Pt/Ir tip, which was
                  formulated by contacting a mechanically formed tip with a
                  solution of H3PW12O40 molecules. Attachment of an H3PW12O40
                  molecule on the metal tip was confirmed by observing the
                  characteristic negative differential resistance (NDR) behavior
                  of H3PW12O40 in tunneling spectroscopy. Atomic resolution
                  images of bare graphite as well as of H6P2W18O62 HPA
                  monolayers on graphite were successfully obtained with a
                  Pt/Ir-HPA tip. In the H3PW12O40 molecule on a metal tip, it is
                  likely that a terminal oxygen of W=O (an oxygen species
                  projecting outward from the pseudospherical H3PW12O40
                  molecule) serves as an atomically sharp and stable tip.
                  Additionally, superimposed superperiodic structures
                  commensurate with the underlying graphite lattice were
                  regularly observed with the modified tips. This result
                  suggests that tip functionalization with these metal oxide
                  molecules may enhance resolution in a fashion analogous to
                  functionalization with C-60.},

                  and data archiving. In this work, we demonstrate a proof of
                  concept for a workflow, org-mode, which successfully provides
                  this authoring capability and workflow integration. We
                  illustrate this concept in a series of examples for potential
                  uses of this workflow. First, we use data on citation counts
                  to compute the h-index of an author, and show two code
                  examples for calculating the h-index. The source for each
                  example is automatically embedded in the PDF during the export
                  of the document. We demonstrate how data can be embedded in
                  image files, which themselves are embedded in the document.
                  Finally, metadata about the embedded files can be
                  automatically included in the exported PDF, and accessed by
                  computer programs. In our customized export, we embedded
                  metadata about the attached files in the PDF in an Info field.
                  A computer program could parse this output to get a list of
                  embedded files and carry out analyses on them. Authoring tools
                  such as Emacs + org-mode can greatly facilitate the
                  integration of data and code into technical writing. These
                  tools can also automate the embedding of data into document
                  formats intended for consumption.",
