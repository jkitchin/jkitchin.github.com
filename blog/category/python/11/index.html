<p>
For the past year I have been seriously exploring whether Python could be used as a practical alternative to Matlab in engineering calculations, particularly in chemical engineering undergraduate and graduate courses. Matlab is very well suited for these calculations, and I have used it extensively in teaching in the past. For example, there is my Matlab blog (<a href="http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu">http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu</a> ), and my cmu Matlab package that contains a very nice units package (<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu">https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu</a> ). Matlab is widely used and recognized as a standard software package in engineering. My university has a site license for Matlab, so it doesn't cost me or my students anything to use. Matlab is easy to install, and has almost everything we need out of the box. So why try using something else then? Here are the main reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Not everyone has access to a "free" Matlab license, and Matlab may not be available to my students when they leave the University. Python offers a free, always available option to them.
</li>
<li>There are several recent Python distributions that are easy to install, and contain almost everything we need for engineering calculations. 
</li>
<li>I have been increasingly integrating code into my lecture notes, and this is not easy with Matlab, but it is easy with Python.
</li>
<li>I use Python exclusively in my research, and although Matlab and Python are similar, they are different enough that switching between them is bothersome to me. I do not like teaching students to use tools I do not regularly use, and I believe I can provide them with more value by teaching with tools I have a high level of proficiency in. 
</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The significance of an open-source alternative</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Many people will be able to use Matlab or some other proprietary software that someone has paid for the license to use. Some people, however, will not have that option for a variety of reasons. Maybe the company they work for will not pay for the license, maybe they are unemployed, or entrepeneurs in a small startup that cannot afford it, maybe they are students at a University without a site license,&#x2026; For these people Python is a viable option that is always available. That makes me happy.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Easy to install Python distributions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
An important development in using Python as an alternative to Matlab is the development of many "one-click" installers. Ten years ago it took me about 2 weeks to download and build a Python environment suitable for scientific and engineering calculations. That has kept me from trying to use Python in teaching in the past. Today, I can download a package and install one in about 10 minutes! More importantly, so can my students.
</p>

<p>
My favorite distribution is the Enthought Canopy distribution (<a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/</a> ). This distribution comes with all the essential python modules, and an integrated editor with IPython. It is available for Windows, Macs and Linux. They offer free academic licenses.
</p>

<p>
Another good alternative is the Anaconda distribution (<a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a> ) by Continuum Analytics. It is also available for Windows, Macs and Linux. I have not used this one, but it looks like it would be very good. Anaconda comes with the Spyder editor. They offer free academic licenses.
</p>

<p>
Python(x,y) is available for Windows (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/</a> ) and comes with the Spyder editor. 
</p>

<p>
WinPython (<a href="http://winpython.sourceforge.net/">http://winpython.sourceforge.net/</a> ) is also available for Windows, and comes with the Spyder editor.
</p>

<p>
The point here is that there are many options available now that make installing a Python distribution as easy as installing packages like Matlab. Enthought Canopy also provides a "desktop environment" similar to Matlab with an editor, documentation browser, package manager and console that is pretty easy to use.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Python by itself is not suitable for typical engineering calculations. You need the numerical, scientific and plotting libraries that provide that functionality. These are provided in numpy, scipy and matplotlib, which are included in the distributions described above. 
</p>

<p>
Typical chemical engineering calculations involve one or more of the following kinds of math problems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/routines.linalg.html">Linear algebra</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html#scipy.optimize.fsolve">Root finding</a> (nonlinear algebra)
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.leastsq.html#scipy.optimize.leastsq">linear regression</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit">Nonlinear regression</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/tutorial/integrate.html">Integration and ordinary differential equations</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/tutorial/stats.html">statistics</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://matplotlib.org/">plotting</a> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these are doable out of the box with the Python distributions discussed above. You can find many examples of using these, and more on my PYCSE blog (<a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu">http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu</a> ) and <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/">http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/</a> . In short, almost every example I put in the Matlab blog has been done in Python. The only ones I did not do yet are some of the interactive graphics with the steam tables. I have not had time to work those out in detail.
</p>

<p>
I have found it convenient to augment theses with a package I wrote called pycse (<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse">https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse</a> ). 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an ode integrator with events similar to the one in Matlab
</li>
<li>some numerical differentiation functions
</li>
<li>linear and nonlinear regression with confidence intervals
</li>
<li>some boundary value problem solvers
</li>
<li>a publish function to convert python scripts to PDF via LaTeX
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This package is still a work in progress. Notably, there is not a really good units package in Python that works as well as my Matlab units package does. Two that come close are <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/quantities/">quantities</a> and <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pint</a> . Both have some nuances that make them tricky for regular use, and both have some challenges in covering all the functions you might want to use them for.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Python from the educator perspective</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Make that my perspective. I have developed an approach to using code in my lectures where I use the code to reinforce the structure of the problems, and to analyze the solutions that result. Doing that means I need to have code to show students, and the output, and sometimes to run the code to illustrate something. I also like these examples integrated into my lecture notes, so they have the right context around them.
</p>

<p>
I have found that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA">Emacs+org-mode+python</a> allows me to easily integrate notes, equations, images, code and output in one place, and then export it to a PDF which I can annotate in class. This ensures that the code and output stay synchronized, that the code is always right where it needs to be, in the right context, and that I can annotate actual code in class, and not pseudocode. This heavily influenced my decision to use Python because it leverages what I already know and want to do. In fact, using it makes me even better at what I already know and helps me learn more about it. That makes me happy!
</p>

<p>
Not everyone will be a content developer like this, but that is what I like to do. Python makes that process fun, and worth doing for me.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Final thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In my opinion Python is and is becoming a more viable alternative to other packages like Matlab for scientific and engineering calculations. I have used it exclusively for about a year solving all kinds of engineering problems that I used to solve in Matlab.
</p>

<p>
Python is different, for sure. The main differences in my opinion are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python is less consistent in syntax than Matlab. For example, there are two ODE solvers in scipy with incompatible syntax. That is a result of the fact that you install a Python distribution made of packages written by many different people with different needs. 
</li>
<li>There is duplicated functionality between numpy and scipy. 
</li>
<li>Some functionality in scipy is provided by external "scikits" (<a href="http://scikits.appspot.com/">http://scikits.appspot.com/</a> ). 
</li>
<li>Support for boundary value problems and partial differential equations is not as good in Python as it is in Matlab <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. At the undergraduate level, this is not a big deal. It is not like the Matlab functions are that easy to use!
</li>
<li>Data regression in Python is not as complete as in Matlab.
</li>
<li>indexing in Python starts at 0, and uses [], whereas in Matlab it starts at 1 and uses ()
</li>
<li>You have to import most functions into Python. In contrast, Matlab has them all in one big namespace.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
It is certainly doable to use Python for many scientific and engineering calculations. This past Fall I took the plunge, and taught a whole core course in chemical reaction engineering using Python! It was a Master's level course with 59 graduate students in it. I have also taught a graduate elective course in Molecular Simulation using Python. I still have some polishing to do before I would teach this to undergraduates, but I think it is definitely worth trying!</p>

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" name="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <p>
It is true there are packages like FiPy (nil) for PDEs, and scikits for BVPS, (nil, nil). But these are not easily installed on all platforms, and typically require some developer experience in compiling.

I have been using <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/jkitchin">CiteULike</a> for a while now to keep a list of articles that are probably worth reading. Basically, each month I get a table of contents from many journals, and as I read through them, if an article catches my attention I add it to my CiteULike account. 
</p>

<p>
This list is not synchronized with my bibtex database however. These serve different purposes. The CiteULike list is for articles that are probably worth reading, while the bibtex file contains articles I am probably going to cite. It should be that every article in my bibtex file is on CiteULike, but not necessarily the other way around. The problem is I do not have a way to push files from my bibtex file to CiteULike easily.
</p>

<p>
CiteULike allows you to <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/profile/jkitchin/import_go">import</a> a bibtex file though. I want to explore automatically importing a bibtex file by simulating the form. We need a set of cookies to make this happen so CiteULike knows who we are. I stored my username and password in a file called citeulike.json and use them to get cookies that I save here in a pickle file. I think this cookie gives you access to your CiteULike account, so it should be kept secret.

The result is that article is now listed in my CiteULike at <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/user/jkitchin/article/12728895">http://www.citeulike.org/user/jkitchin/article/12728895</a> .  This opens the possibility of integrating this into my bibtex workflow. I could implement this in emacs-lisp, and have it automatically upload new entries in the bibtex file to CiteULike. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Doing this in emacs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I think the easiest thing to do here is to write a python script that takes the bibtex string and posts it. We will use emacs to get the bibtex string. We will use the example at  <a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_perl_wrapper.html">http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_perl_wrapper.html</a> to put this together. This example uses an external script that takes a string on stdin, and returns a result on stdout.
</p>

<p>
We will run the function in a bibtex buffer. We will narrow the buffer to the current entry, and use that to define the boundaries of the string. We do the command in a temp-buffer to prevent it from modifying our bibtex file. There is some way to make the command not do this with optional arguments, but I did not figure it out. It is a little ugly I had to use an absolute path below. An alternative would be to put the script into a directory on your path. Here is the function.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #8b0000;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">j/upload-bibtex-entry-to-citeulike</span> ()

  (interactive)
  (<span style="color: #8b0000;">save-restriction</span>
    (bibtex-narrow-to-entry)
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">let</span> ((startpos (point-min))
          (endpos (point-max))
          (bibtex-string (buffer-string))
          (script <span style="color: #228b22;">"python c:/Users/jkitchin/Dropbox/blogofile-jkitchin.github.com/_blog/upload_bibtex_citeulike.py"</span>))
      (<span style="color: #8b0000;">with-temp-buffer</span> (insert bibtex-string)
                        (shell-command-on-region (point-min) (point-max) script t nil nil t)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, let us define the python script.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<span style="color: #8b008b;">data</span> = {<span style="color: #228b22;">'pasted'</span>:bibtex,

</pre>
</div>

<p>
That is it. Now, in my bibtex file with the cursor in an entry, I type M-x j/upload-bibtex-entry-to-citeulike, and a few seconds later the entry has been uploaded!

I have come across some very interesting online, <i>interactive</i> python sites recently.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://interactivepython.org" >http://interactivepython.org</a> has some interactive books with embedded python interpreters in the exercises. 
</li>

<li>sympy actually has an <a href="http://live.sympy.org/" >online shell</a>! The <a href="http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.2/index.html" >documentation</a> has live examples in a shell you can use that is integrated with Sphinx. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are a few others I came across:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/" >https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/</a> Ipython in your browser!

<p>
Python has some nice features in creating functions. You can create default values for variables, have optional variables and optional keyword variables.
In this function f(a,b), <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are called positional arguments, and they are required, and must be provided in the same order as the function defines.
</p>

<p>
If we provide a default value for an argument, then the argument is called a keyword argument, and it becomes optional. You can combine positional arguments and keyword arguments, but positional arguments must come first. Here is an example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(a, n=2):
    <span style="color: #228b22;">"compute the nth power of a"</span>
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> a**n

<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;"># </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">three different ways to call the function</span>
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(2)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(2, 3)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(2, n=4)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
4
8
16
</pre>

<p>
In the first call to the function, we only define the argument <code>a</code>, which is a mandatory, positional argument. In the second call, we define <code>a</code> and <code>n</code>, in the order they are defined in the function. Finally, in the third call, we define <code>a</code> as a positional argument, and <code>n</code> as a keyword argument.
</p>

<p>
If all of the arguments are optional, we can even call the function with no arguments. If you give arguments as positional arguments, they are used in the order defined in the function. If you use keyword arguments, the order is arbitrary.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(a=1, n=2):
    <span style="color: #228b22;">"compute the nth power of a"</span>
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> a**n

<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;"># </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">three different ways to call the function</span>
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func()
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(2, 4)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(n=4, a=2)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
1
16
16
</pre>

<p>
It is occasionally useful to allow an arbitrary number of arguments in a function. Suppose we want a function that can take an arbitrary number of positional arguments and return the sum of all the arguments. We use the syntax <code>*args</code> to indicate arbitrary positional arguments. Inside the function the variable <code>args</code> is a tuple containing all of the arguments passed to the function. 
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(*args):
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">sum</span> = 0
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">for</span> arg <span style="color: #8b0000;">in</span> args:
        <span style="color: #8b0000;">sum</span> += arg
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">sum</span>

<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(1, 2, 3, 4)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
10
</pre>

<p>
A more &ldquo;functional programming&rdquo; version of the last function is given here. This is an advanced approach that is less readable to new users, but more compact and likely more efficient for large numbers of arguments.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> operator
<span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(*args):
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">return</span> <span style="color: #8b0000;">reduce</span>(operator.add, args)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> func(1, 2, 3, 4)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
10
</pre>

<p>
It is possible to have arbitrary keyword arguments. This is a common pattern when you call another function within your function that takes keyword arguments. We use <code>**kwargs</code> to indicate that arbitrary keyword arguments can be given to the function. Inside the function, kwargs is variable containing a dictionary of the keywords and values passed in.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">func</span>(**kwargs):
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">for</span> kw <span style="color: #8b0000;">in</span> kwargs:
        <span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">'{0} = {1}'</span>.format(kw, kwargs[kw])

func(t1=6, color=<span style="color: #228b22;">'blue'</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
color = blue
t1 = 6
</pre>

<p>
A typical example might be:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> plt

<span style="color: #8b0000;">def</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">myplot</span>(x, y, fname=<span style="color: #8b0000;">None</span>, **kwargs):
    <span style="color: #228b22;">"make plot of x,y. save to fname if not None. provide kwargs to plot"</span>
    plt.plot(x, y, **kwargs)
    plt.xlabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'X'</span>)
    plt.ylabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'Y'</span>)
    plt.title(<span style="color: #228b22;">'My plot'</span>)
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> fname:
        plt.savefig(fname)
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">else:</span>
        plt.show()

x = [1, 3, 4, 5]
y = [3, 6, 9, 12]

myplot(x, y, <span style="color: #228b22;">'images/myfig.png'</span>, color=<span style="color: #228b22;">'orange'</span>, marker=<span style="color: #228b22;">'s'</span>)

<span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;"># </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">you can use a dictionary as kwargs</span>
d = {<span style="color: #228b22;">'color'</span>:<span style="color: #228b22;">'magenta'</span>,
     <span style="color: #228b22;">'marker'</span>:<span style="color: #228b22;">'d'</span>}

myplot(x, y, <span style="color: #228b22;">'images/myfig2.png'</span>, **d)
</pre>
</div>

<p><img src="/img/./images/myfig.png"><p>

<p><img src="/img/./images/myfig2.png"><p>

<p>
In that example we wrap the matplotlib plotting commands in a function, which we can call the way we want to, with arbitrary optional arguments. In this example, you cannot pass keyword arguments that are illegal to the plot command or you will get an error.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to combine all the options at once. I admit it is hard to imagine where this would be really useful, but it can be done!

<p>
It is common to evaluate a function for a range of values. Let us consider the value of the function \(f(x) = \cos(x)\) over the range of \(0 < x < \pi\). We cannot consider every value in that range, but we can consider say 10 points in the range. The nil conveniently creates an array of values.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> numpy <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> np
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
[ 0.          0.34906585  0.6981317   1.04719755  1.3962634   1.74532925
  2.0943951   2.44346095  2.7925268   3.14159265]
</pre>

<p>
The main point of using the nil functions is that they work element-wise on elements of an array. In this example, we compute the \(\cos(x)\) for each element of \(x\).
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> numpy <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> np
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, 10)
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> np.cos(x)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
[ 1.          0.93969262  0.76604444  0.5         0.17364818 -0.17364818
 -0.5        -0.76604444 -0.93969262 -1.        ]
</pre>

<p>
You can already see from this output that there is a root to the equation \(\cos(x) = 0\), because there is a change in sign in the output. This is not a very convenient way to view the results; a graph would be better.  We use nil to make figures. Here is an example.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> plt

This figure illustrates graphically what the numbers above show. The function crosses zero at approximately \(x = 1.5\). To get a more precise value, we must actually solve the function numerically. We use the function nil to do that. More precisely, we want to solve the equation \(f(x) = \cos(x) = 0\). We create a function that defines that equation, and then use nil to solve it.
