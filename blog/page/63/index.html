<p>
I am going to be assigning homeworks and quizzes in org-mode next semester, and it would be nice if there was a function that would save the file with the right name in the right place. The file will have some keywords at the top to identify the student, course and assignment. Those look like:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+NAME: John Kitchin
#+ANDREWID: jkitchin
#+COURSE: 06-640
#+ASSIGNMENT: quiz1
</pre>

<p>
I would like a function that saves the current buffer to a file like /some-path/ANDREWID-COURSE-ASSIGNMENT.org. That will be "turning the assignment in" so I can do some analysis of the files. I previously wrote about getting keywords from org-files <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/05/05/Getting-keyword-options-in-org-files/">here</a> . We will build on that to accomplish this goal. Here is the function that seems to do what I want. For now it saves the file in the same directory, with the correct name.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #8b0000;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">submit-assignment</span> ()
  <span style="color: #228b22;">"Save current buffer to assignment. You must set #+ANDREWID, #+COURSE and #+ASSIGNMENT. There is no checking for this."</span>
  (interactive)
  (save-buffer)
  (<span style="color: #8b0000;">let</span> ((org-keywords (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer 'element) 'keyword
                        (<span style="color: #8b0000;">lambda</span> (keyword) (cons (org-element-property <span style="color: #cd0000;">:key</span> keyword)
                                                (org-element-property <span style="color: #cd0000;">:value</span> keyword)))))
        (assignment-content (buffer-string)) <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">store contents to write to file later</span>
        (assignment-filename))
    <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">;; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">create the filename we will save the buffer in</span>
    (setq assignment-filename (concat (cdr (assoc <span style="color: #228b22;">"ANDREWID"</span> org-keywords))
                                      <span style="color: #228b22;">"-"</span>
                                      (cdr (assoc <span style="color: #228b22;">"COURSE"</span> org-keywords))
                                      <span style="color: #228b22;">"-"</span>
                                      (cdr (assoc <span style="color: #228b22;">"ASSIGNMENT"</span> org-keywords))
                                      <span style="color: #228b22;">".org"</span>))
    <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">;; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">now write out contents to filename</span>
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">with-temp-file</span> assignment-filename
      (insert assignment-content))
    (message <span style="color: #228b22;">"%s was submitted"</span> assignment-filename)))

(submit-assignment)
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
jkitchin-06-640-quiz1.org was submitted
</pre>

<p>
Now, we have a nice function that can be put as a link in the org-file: <pre>elisp:submit-assignment</pre> , or <pre>elisp:submit-assignment</pre> . The assignment will be copied to a location specified, and I can grade it, assess it, etc&#x2026; from there. That function will have to be loaded by students, but since I provide them with lisp files that are loaded at startup that should not be an issue. 
</p>

<p>
This solution lacks some features I have to think about. For example, if the path where everyone submits to is common, everyone will be able to read the file, which is not desirable. It is also not feasible to make the submitted files read-only to the students this way (so they cannot modify the files after they turn them in). I could have the submit function do something like submit to box.com by email.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure how grading of these files would go. In the past, I have preferred PDF files (which you can export org to) because I could grade them using a tablet without modifying the actual content in the files. However it would not be simple at all to export an org-file to PDF with that data in a machine readable way. One point of having them in org-mode is that I could collect statistics from the headings of many files pretty easily. I have written code to annotate org-files in the past, which I might have to dig out. 
</p>

<p>
There is a limitation of the submit function, and that is if the org-file references images or other files (I would expect many of my assignments would have plots in them). Those would not be copied to the right place. I handle those when I publish the blog, so it could be done. But, it would require creating a new directory, and writing all the files to it (including making sure the relative paths are handled correctly), or creating some kind of zip-archive that contains everything. That sounds like a project for another day!

<p>
I have been exploring ways to facilitate learning and grading. One way I like is to provide quizzes inline with text
Here are some examples of "interactive" quizzes with feedback to the user in org-mode. The principle idea is to use a headline for the question, and use properties to hold the answer. The answers are coded into links that run lisp code to check if the link text matches the correct answer. The properties are folded, so you have to willfully cheat to look at the answer. For getting instant feedback, this isn't such an issue. These aren't for formal assessment, but for knowledge checkpoints in active learning.
</p>

<p>
Blog alert: The links may only work in the actual org-file in Emacs, they will not function in html.  
</p>

<p>
Here is an example in a subheading. These links play an amusing sound (crowd cheers for correct answer, a buzzer for a wrong answer). The sounds are stored locally with the file. This gives students immediate feedback on their answer. These might be incorporated into reading assignments.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> What is 2 + 4?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
a) <pre>elisp:(if (string= "4" (org-entry-get (point) "CORRECT-ANSWER"))  (play-sound-file "sounds/99636__tomlija__small-crowd-yelling-yeah.wav" 0.91 nil) (play-sound-file "sounds/fail-buzzer-01.wav" 0.91 nil))</pre> 
</p>

<p>
b) <pre>elisp:(if (string= "6" (org-entry-get (point) "CORRECT-ANSWER"))  (play-sound-file "sounds/99636__tomlija__small-crowd-yelling-yeah.wav" 0.91 nil) (play-sound-file "sounds/fail-buzzer-01.wav" 0.91 nil))</pre> 
</p>

<p>
c) <pre>elisp:(if (string= "-2" (org-entry-get (point) "CORRECT-ANSWER"))  (play-sound-file "sounds/99636__tomlija__small-crowd-yelling-yeah.wav" 0.91 nil) (play-sound-file "sounds/fail-buzzer-01.wav" 0.91 nil))</pre> 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Lets make a custom link for this</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Hand coding the links isn't very convenient. Let us write an org-link function that is more convenient. This new function will also record the number of correct and incorrect attempts. You could hard code some sound into them, but I did not do that here.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(org-add-link-type 
 <span style="color: #228b22;">"ans"</span> 
 (<span style="color: #8b0000;">lambda</span> (path) 
   (<span style="color: #8b0000;">let*</span> ((correct-answer (org-entry-get (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"CORRECT-ANSWER"</span>))
          (ncorrect (org-entry-get (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-CORRECT"</span>))
          (num-correct (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> ncorrect (string-to-number ncorrect) 0))
          (nincorrect (org-entry-get (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-INCORRECT"</span>))
          (num-incorrect (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> nincorrect (string-to-number nincorrect) 0)))
     (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> (string= path correct-answer) 
         (<span style="color: #8b0000;">progn</span>
          (org-entry-put (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-CORRECT"</span> (number-to-string (+ num-correct 1)))
          (message <span style="color: #228b22;">"correct"</span>))
       (org-entry-put (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-INCORRECT"</span> (number-to-string (+ num-incorrect 1)))
       (message <span style="color: #228b22;">"incorrect"</span>)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That function was a bit trickier than I thought it would be. First, I used let* because the first time you click on a link the correct answer counters may not exist, so getting the property would return nil. If it is nil, then we should initialize to 0. If it is not nil, we need to convert the string that is returned to an integer so we can add to it later. Then, we need to convert that integer back to a string to store it as a property, otherwise it is stored as some strange control character. 
</p>

<p>
Now, we can put our question in.
question: Is 3 greater than 2?
</p>

<p>
Here are the new links:  <pre>ans:yes</pre> <pre>ans:no</pre> 
</p>


<p>
That function goes along way to making it pretty easy to write the answers. One limitation here is that you can only put one question per section. We address that later. It is still easy to cheat if you want. We could do a few things to make that harder. One idea would be to encrypt the answers, and compare the hash of the answers. Another is to just record what was clicked on, and then grade it later. In the next section we try that out.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><a id="ID-fa6cc63f-e2da-47a7-9721-cb970dde335e" name="ID-fa6cc63f-e2da-47a7-9721-cb970dde335e"></a><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Storing quiz answers and number of attempts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>
Here, we store the answer, and number of attempts. Students won't get feedback from this approach, but they cannot cheat either. They could just type answers in to the org-file, but this approach is like a Scantron multiple choice exam that could be automatically graded later. You could use something like this as an electronic clicker to quickly assess everyone's understanding of some concepts.
</p>

<p>
Here is our new link function.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(org-add-link-type 
 <span style="color: #228b22;">"ans2"</span> 
 (<span style="color: #8b0000;">lambda</span> (path) 
   (org-entry-put (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"ANSWER"</span> path)
   (<span style="color: #8b0000;">let*</span> ((nattempts (org-entry-get (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-ATTEMPTS"</span>))
          (num-attempts (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> nattempts (string-to-number nattempts) 0)))
     (org-entry-put (point) <span style="color: #228b22;">"NUM-ATTEMPTS"</span> (number-to-string (+ num-attempts 1))))
   (message <span style="color: #228b22;">"You selected %s for your answer"</span> path)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
And now a question: Is 3 greater than 2?
<pre>ans2:yes</pre> <pre>ans2:no</pre> 
</p>

<p>
This way works very well. It might also be a good idea to give each question a unique id (org-id-get-create) so you can collect specific results. 
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Using inline tasks instead of headings</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
If you were integrating these into a book, it would be inconvenient to use headings because they would mess up the outline. We can use inline tasks instead.
</p>

<div class="inlinetask">
<b>Is 3 greater than 2?</b><br  />
<p>
<pre>ans2:yes</pre> <pre>ans2:no</pre> 
</p>
</div>

<p>
This adds some additional lines, but does not change the heading level. We can put multiple questions in then.
</p>

<div class="inlinetask">
<b>What is 4*4?</b><br  />
<p>
<pre>ans2:16</pre> <pre>ans2:18</pre> <pre>ans2:8</pre> 
</p>
</div>

<p>
Interesing, I noticed in this last example that a link path must have at least two characters to be automatically recognized by org-mode. I had to put double square brackets to make it a link!
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Concluding thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
This seems like a pretty promising approach to getting structured input from students. You would have to invest some time training them to use emacs and org-mode, and not modify the file in ways they are not supposed to.  You would also have to invest some time in writing analysis code to collect all the answers and analyze them somehow. I do not think that would be too hard though, and the payoff could be large. By giving students quick feedback they could have a better understanding of what they know, and might ask better questions. This could be a useful approach to active learning activities that students work on while reading.

For the past year I have been seriously exploring whether Python could be used as a practical alternative to Matlab in engineering calculations, particularly in chemical engineering undergraduate and graduate courses. Matlab is very well suited for these calculations, and I have used it extensively in teaching in the past. For example, there is my Matlab blog (<a href="http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu">http://matlab.cheme.cmu.edu</a> ), and my cmu Matlab package that contains a very nice units package (<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu">https://github.com/jkitchin/matlab-cmu</a> ). Matlab is widely used and recognized as a standard software package in engineering. My university has a site license for Matlab, so it doesn't cost me or my students anything to use. Matlab is easy to install, and has almost everything we need out of the box. So why try using something else then? Here are the main reasons:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Not everyone has access to a "free" Matlab license, and Matlab may not be available to my students when they leave the University. Python offers a free, always available option to them.
</li>
<li>There are several recent Python distributions that are easy to install, and contain almost everything we need for engineering calculations. 
</li>
<li>I have been increasingly integrating code into my lecture notes, and this is not easy with Matlab, but it is easy with Python.
</li>
<li>I use Python exclusively in my research, and although Matlab and Python are similar, they are different enough that switching between them is bothersome to me. I do not like teaching students to use tools I do not regularly use, and I believe I can provide them with more value by teaching with tools I have a high level of proficiency in. 
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The significance of an open-source alternative</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Many people will be able to use Matlab or some other proprietary software that someone has paid for the license to use. Some people, however, will not have that option for a variety of reasons. Maybe the company they work for will not pay for the license, maybe they are unemployed, or entrepeneurs in a small startup that cannot afford it, maybe they are students at a University without a site license,&#x2026; For these people Python is a viable option that is always available. That makes me happy.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
An important development in using Python as an alternative to Matlab is the development of many "one-click" installers. Ten years ago it took me about 2 weeks to download and build a Python environment suitable for scientific and engineering calculations. That has kept me from trying to use Python in teaching in the past. Today, I can download a package and install one in about 10 minutes! More importantly, so can my students.
</p>

<p>
My favorite distribution is the Enthought Canopy distribution (<a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/</a> ). This distribution comes with all the essential python modules, and an integrated editor with IPython. It is available for Windows, Macs and Linux. They offer free academic licenses.
</p>

<p>
Another good alternative is the Anaconda distribution (<a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/</a> ) by Continuum Analytics. It is also available for Windows, Macs and Linux. I have not used this one, but it looks like it would be very good. Anaconda comes with the Spyder editor. They offer free academic licenses.
</p>

<p>
Python(x,y) is available for Windows (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/</a> ) and comes with the Spyder editor. 
</p>

<p>
WinPython (<a href="http://winpython.sourceforge.net/">http://winpython.sourceforge.net/</a> ) is also available for Windows, and comes with the Spyder editor.
</p>

<p>
The point here is that there are many options available now that make installing a Python distribution as easy as installing packages like Matlab. Enthought Canopy also provides a "desktop environment" similar to Matlab with an editor, documentation browser, package manager and console that is pretty easy to use.

Python by itself is not suitable for typical engineering calculations. You need the numerical, scientific and plotting libraries that provide that functionality. These are provided in numpy, scipy and matplotlib, which are included in the distributions described above. 
</p>

<p>
Typical chemical engineering calculations involve one or more of the following kinds of math problems:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/reference/routines.linalg.html">Linear algebra</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html#scipy.optimize.fsolve">Root finding</a> (nonlinear algebra)
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.leastsq.html#scipy.optimize.leastsq">linear regression</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html#scipy.optimize.curve_fit">Nonlinear regression</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/tutorial/integrate.html">Integration and ordinary differential equations</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/tutorial/stats.html">statistics</a> 
</li>
<li><a href="http://matplotlib.org/">plotting</a> 
</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these are doable out of the box with the Python distributions discussed above. You can find many examples of using these, and more on my PYCSE blog (<a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu">http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu</a> ) and <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/">http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/pycse/</a> . In short, almost every example I put in the Matlab blog has been done in Python. The only ones I did not do yet are some of the interactive graphics with the steam tables. I have not had time to work those out in detail.
</p>

<p>
I have found it convenient to augment theses with a package I wrote called pycse (<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse">https://github.com/jkitchin/pycse</a> ). 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>an ode integrator with events similar to the one in Matlab
</li>
<li>some numerical differentiation functions
</li>
<li>linear and nonlinear regression with confidence intervals
</li>
<li>some boundary value problem solvers
</li>
<li>a publish function to convert python scripts to PDF via LaTeX
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This package is still a work in progress. Notably, there is not a really good units package in Python that works as well as my Matlab units package does. Two that come close are <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/quantities/">quantities</a> and <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pint</a> . Both have some nuances that make them tricky for regular use, and both have some challenges in covering all the functions you might want to use them for.

<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Python from the educator perspective</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Make that my perspective. I have developed an approach to using code in my lectures where I use the code to reinforce the structure of the problems, and to analyze the solutions that result. Doing that means I need to have code to show students, and the output, and sometimes to run the code to illustrate something. I also like these examples integrated into my lecture notes, so they have the right context around them.
</p>

<p>
I have found that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-dUkyn_fZA">Emacs+org-mode+python</a> allows me to easily integrate notes, equations, images, code and output in one place, and then export it to a PDF which I can annotate in class. This ensures that the code and output stay synchronized, that the code is always right where it needs to be, in the right context, and that I can annotate actual code in class, and not pseudocode. This heavily influenced my decision to use Python because it leverages what I already know and want to do. In fact, using it makes me even better at what I already know and helps me learn more about it. That makes me happy!
</p>

<p>
Not everyone will be a content developer like this, but that is what I like to do. Python makes that process fun, and worth doing for me.

<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Final thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
In my opinion Python is and is becoming a more viable alternative to other packages like Matlab for scientific and engineering calculations. I have used it exclusively for about a year solving all kinds of engineering problems that I used to solve in Matlab.
</p>

<p>
Python is different, for sure. The main differences in my opinion are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Python is less consistent in syntax than Matlab. For example, there are two ODE solvers in scipy with incompatible syntax. That is a result of the fact that you install a Python distribution made of packages written by many different people with different needs. 
</li>
<li>There is duplicated functionality between numpy and scipy. 
</li>
<li>Some functionality in scipy is provided by external "scikits" (<a href="http://scikits.appspot.com/">http://scikits.appspot.com/</a> ). 
</li>
<li>Support for boundary value problems and partial differential equations is not as good in Python as it is in Matlab <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. At the undergraduate level, this is not a big deal. It is not like the Matlab functions are that easy to use!
</li>
<li>Data regression in Python is not as complete as in Matlab.
</li>
<li>indexing in Python starts at 0, and uses [], whereas in Matlab it starts at 1 and uses ()
</li>
<li>You have to import most functions into Python. In contrast, Matlab has them all in one big namespace.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
It is certainly doable to use Python for many scientific and engineering calculations. This past Fall I took the plunge, and taught a whole core course in chemical reaction engineering using Python! It was a Master's level course with 59 graduate students in it. I have also taught a graduate elective course in Molecular Simulation using Python. I still have some polishing to do before I would teach this to undergraduates, but I think it is definitely worth trying!</p>

It is true there are packages like FiPy (nil) for PDEs, and scikits for BVPS, (nil, nil). But these are not easily installed on all platforms, and typically require some developer experience in compiling.

I have found using tables in an org-file as data sources to code blocks very convenient for documenting work. A typical work flow might go like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Use a code block to generate some data in an org-table.
</li>
<li>Use another code block to analyze the data.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
For example, here is a code block that prints data in a table <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> numpy <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> np

<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">'#+tblname: cos-data'</span>
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">'| x | cos(x)|'</span>
<span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">'|-'</span>

<span style="color: #8b0000;">for</span> x <span style="color: #8b0000;">in</span> np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 10):
    <span style="color: #8b0000;">print</span> <span style="color: #228b22;">'|{0}|{1}|'</span>.<span style="color: #cd0000;">format</span>(x, np.cos(x))
</pre>
</div>

<table id="cos-data" border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<p>
Now, we use that table in a code block to plot the data. We do this by using some header arguments to the code block:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var data=cos-data
</pre>

<p>
Then we can use the <code>data</code> variable inside the code block like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> numpy <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> np
<span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> matplotlib.pyplot <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> plt

<span style="color: #8b008b;">data</span> = np.array(data) <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;"># </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">data is a list coming in</span>
<span style="color: #8b008b;">x</span> = data[:, 0]
<span style="color: #8b008b;">y</span> = data[:, 1]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'x'</span>)
plt.ylabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'cos(x)'</span>)
plt.savefig(<span style="color: #228b22;">'images/cos-plot.png'</span>)
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/media/2013-12-22-Using-data-in-a-table-in-another-org-file/cos-plot.png"> 
</p>
</div>

<p>
That is pretty awesome, but what if we have data in a table from another org-file? It turns out we can use it too. I have data for the sin(x) stored in a table called <code>sin-data</code> in <a href="/media/2013-12-22-Using-data-in-a-table-in-another-org-file/sin.org">sin.org</a> , which I now want to use. We can access that table like this in a header arg:
</p>

<pre class="example">
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var data=sin.org:sin-data
</pre>

<p>
And now use the data variable just like before!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-python"><span style="color: #8b0000;">import</span> numpy <span style="color: #8b0000;">as</span> np

<span style="color: #8b008b;">x</span> = data[:, 0]
<span style="color: #8b008b;">y</span> = data[:, 1]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'x'</span>)
plt.ylabel(<span style="color: #228b22;">'sin(x)'</span>)
plt.savefig(<span style="color: #228b22;">'images/sin-plot.png'</span>)
</pre>
</div>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/media/2013-12-22-Using-data-in-a-table-in-another-org-file/sin-plot.png">

<p>
This is a powerful capability, as it allows you to pull data from other files into your current analysis. For example, the supporting information files from some of our recent publications have org-files embedded in them with data stored in org-tables. You could use that data in your own analysis without having to type it in yourself. The only thing you need to do is make sure each table in a document is uniquely named.
</p>

<p>
I previously worked out an <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2013/03/05/An-index-function-for-strings-in-emacs-lisp/">index</a> function for a list of strings in emacs-lisp, but at the end I showed it would not work for arbitrary elements of a list. Here is an exercise to improve on that. The goal is a function that looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(index 1 '("a" 2 1 "b"))
</pre>
<p>
that would return 2 in this case. Last time I used string=, which is why I could not find a number in the list. This time, we will use <code>equal</code> (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Equality-Predicates.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Equality-Predicates.html</a> ) which compares components of objects for equality. That should let us find arbitrary objects in a list. 
</p>

<p>
Here is our improved function:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #8b0000;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">index</span> (object list)
  <span style="color: #228b22;">"return the index of object in list"</span>
  (<span style="color: #8b0000;">let</span> ((counter 0)
        (found nil))
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">catch</span> '<span style="color: #cd0000;">finished</span>
      (<span style="color: #8b0000;">dolist</span> (listelement list counter)
        (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> (equal object listelement)
            (<span style="color: #8b0000;">progn</span>
              (setq found t)
              (<span style="color: #8b0000;">throw</span> '<span style="color: #cd0000;">finished</span> counter))
          <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">;; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">else increment counter</span>
          (incf counter)))
    <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">;; </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold;">if we found it return counter otherwise return nil</span>
    (<span style="color: #8b0000;">if</span> found counter nil))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now, let us test some examples:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(index 1 '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"a"</span> 2 1 <span style="color: #228b22;">"b"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
2
</pre>

<p>
No problem finding a number in a list.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(index <span style="color: #228b22;">"b"</span> '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"a"</span> 2 1 <span style="color: #228b22;">"b"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
3

<p>
How about something more complicated, like a list in a list?
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(index '(1 2) '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"a"</span> 2 1 (1 2) <span style="color: #228b22;">"b"</span>))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
3
</pre>

<p>
That looks good.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(princ (index '(1 2) '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"a"</span> 2 1 (2 (1 2)) <span style="color: #228b22;">"b"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
nil
</pre>

<p>
Note, we do not find the nested object. That is ok, the location of that object would require two indices, which this function is not designed for. 
</p>

<p>
Here we consider an object of an a-list
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(index '(<span style="color: #228b22;">"nut"</span> . <span style="color: #228b22;">"acorn"</span>) '((<span style="color: #228b22;">"nut"</span> . <span style="color: #228b22;">"acorn"</span>) (<span style="color: #228b22;">"fruit"</span> . <span style="color: #228b22;">"apple"</span>)))
</pre>
</div>

<pre class="example">
0
</pre>

<p>
I am not quite sure how you would use that, but it does illustrate the generality of the index function!
