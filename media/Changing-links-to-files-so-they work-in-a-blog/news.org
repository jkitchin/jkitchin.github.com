Our paper "Effects of O2 and SO2 on the capture capacity of a primary-amine based polymeric CO2 sorbent" by Alexander Hallenbeck and John R. Kitchin was accepted today in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research. In this paper we showed that the ion exchange resin OC1065 is  susceptible to poisoning by SO2, but that it can be partially chemically regenerated. It can also be damaged by long term exposure to air at elevated temperatures.

Our manuscript titled "Comparisons of Amine Solvents for Post-combustion CO$_2$ Capture: A Multi-objective Analysis Approach" by Anita Lee, John Eslick, David Miller, and John Kitchin was just accepted in International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control. In this paper we used a genetic algorithm to find pareto-optimal operating conditions of amine solvent CO2 capture systems that minimize capital cost and parasitic power cost. We compared MEA, DEA and AMP, and found that there are operating conditions where both solvents could be better than MEA.

This meeting will be held in Beijing, China from May 15 to 17. Here is a description of the meeting from the website:

"CAFOE
2013 China-America Frontiers of Engineering Symposium

From May 15 - 17, the 2013 China-America Frontiers of Engineering will take place in Beijing, China. Sixty of the most promising engineers under the age of 45 from China and the United States will meet for an intensive 2-1/2 day symposium on developments at the cutting edge of engineering technology. The event is intended to facilitate international and cross-disciplinary research collaboration, promote the transfer of new techniques and approaches across disparate engineering fields, and encourage the creation of a transpacific network of world-class engineers."

Professor Kitchin will present his work in CO2 capture, water splitting, computational materials design and computing in engineering at a poster session in this meeting.

This meeting is hosted by the National Academy of Engineering and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. Learn more at  http://www.naefrontiers.org/Symposia/CAFOE.aspx
