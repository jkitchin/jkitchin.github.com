  abstract =	 "Next generation of gas separation materials are
                  needed to alleviate issues faced in energy and
                  environmental area. Ionic liquids (ILs) are
                  promising class of material for CO2 separations. In
                  this work{,} CO2 reactive triazolides ILs were
                  synthesized and characterized with the aim of
                  developing deeper understanding on how structural
                  changes affect the overall properties for CO2
                  separation. Important insights were gained
                  illustrating the effects of substituents on the
                  anion. It was found that substituents play a crucial
                  role in dictating the overall physical properties of
                  reactive ionic liquids. Depending upon the
                  electronic and steric nature of the substituent{,}
                  CO2 capacities between 0.07-0.4 mol CO2/mol IL were
                  observed. Detailed spectroscopic{,} CO2
                  absorption{,} rheological{,} and simulation studies
                  were carried out to understand the nature and
                  influence of these substituents. The effect of water
                  content was also evaluated{,} and it was found that
                  water had an unexpected impact on the properties of
                  these materials{,} resulting in an increased
                  viscosity{,} but little change in the CO2
                  reactivity."
