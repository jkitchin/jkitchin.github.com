                  adsorption energy of oxygen on an oxide surface into a sum of
                  the adsorption energy on the metal and a change in adsorption
                  energy caused by both expanding and oxidizing the lattice. We
                  were able to identify the key features of the electronic
                  structure that explains the trends in adsorption energies on
                  3d transition metal monoxide surfaces. ",
