I really dislike preparing notebooks though. A browser is a really poor editor, and I really dislike Markdown. Notebooks do not seem to have any real structure in them, e.g. the collapsible outline that I am used to in org-mode, so for long notebooks, it is difficult to get a sense for the structure. I am anticipating spending up to 80 hours preparing notebooks this semester, so today I worked out some code to export org-mode to an ipython notebook! \n\nThis will let me use the power tools I am accustomed to for the creation of IPython notebooks for my students, and perhaps others who do not use org-mode. \n\nJupyter notebooks are just json files, so all we need to do is generate it from an org document. The basic strategy was to build up a lisp data structure that represents the notebook and then just convert that data structure to json. I split the document up into sequential markdown and code cells, and then encode those in the format required for the notebook (json).\n\nSo, here is an example of what can be easily written in org-mode, posted to this blog, and exported to an IPython notebook, all from one org-document.\n\nCheck out the notebook:  [./exporting-orgmode-to-ipynb.ipynb](./exporting-orgmode-to-ipynb.ipynb). \n\n\n## Solve a nonlinear problem\n\nConsider the equation $x^2 = 4$. Find a solution to it in Python using a nonlinear solver. \n\nTo do that, we need to define an objective function that will be equal to zero at the solution. Here is the function:\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":""}],"source":["def objective(x):\n    return x**2 - 4"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Next, we use fsolve with an initial guess.

And emacs\n3.  and ipynb for teaching.\n\nThe export supports org-markup: **bold**, *italic*, <span class=\"underline\">underlined</span>, and ~~strike~~.\n\nWe can use tables:\n\n<table border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"6\" rules=\"groups\" frame=\"hsides\">\n<caption class=\"t-above\"><span class=\"table-number\">Table 1:</span> A table of squares.</caption>\n\n<colgroup>\n<col  class=\"org-right\" />\n\n<col  class=\"org-right\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-right\">x</th>\n<th scope=\"col\" class=\"org-right\">y</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td class=\"org-right\">1</td>\n<td class=\"org-right\">2</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td class=\"org-right\">2</td>\n<td class=\"org-right\">4</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td class=\"org-right\">3</td>\n<td class=\"org-right\">9</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n<tr>\n<td class=\"org-right\">4</td>\n<td class=\"org-right\">16</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nWe can make plots.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":""}],"source":["import numpy as np\n\nt = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi)\n\nx = np.cos(t)\ny = np.sin(t)\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.axis('equal')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('y')\nplt.savefig('circle.png')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["![img](./circle.png)\n\nEven include HTML:\n<font color=\"red\">Pay special attention to the axis labels!</font>\n\n\n# Limitations\n\n-   Only supports iPython blocks\n-   Does not do inline images in results\n-   Will not support src-block variables\n-   Currently only supports vanilla output results\n\n\n# Summary\n\nThe code that does this is here: [./ox-ipynb.el](./ox-ipynb.el). After I use it a while I will put it in scimax. There are some tricks in it to fix up some markdown export of latex fragments and links with no descriptions.\n\nI just run this command in Emacs to get the notebook.
