This grant will support "Reproducible Research: Computing in Science and Engineering" - Developing a new undergraduate course that integrates professional tools so engineering students can learn and practice modern methods of reproducible research. (John Kitchin)

This will be a project that integrates emacs, org-mode and computing into the creation of literate technical documents.
