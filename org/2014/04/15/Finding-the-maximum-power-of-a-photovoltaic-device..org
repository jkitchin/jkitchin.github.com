A photovoltaic device is characterized by a current-voltage relationship. Let us say, for argument's sake, that the relationship is known and defined by

\(i = 0.5 - 0.5 * V^2\)

The voltage is highest when the current is equal to zero, but of course then you get no power. The current is highest when the voltage is zero, i.e. short-circuited, but there is again no power. We seek the highest power condition, which is to find the maximum of \(i V\). This is a constrained optimization. We solve it by creating an objective function that returns the negative of (\i V\), and then find the minimum.

First, let us examine the i-V relationship.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

V = np.linspace(0, 1)

def i(V):
    return 0.5 - 0.5 * V**2

plt.figure()
plt.plot(V, i(V))
plt.savefig('images/iV.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: <matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x11193ec18>
: [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x111d43668>]

Now, let us be sure there is a maximum in power.
#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

V = np.linspace(0, 1)

def i(V):
    return 0.5 - 0.5 * V**2

plt.plot(V, i(V) * V)
plt.savefig('images/P1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x111d437f0>]

You can see in fact there is a maximum, near V=0.6. We could solve this problem analytically by taking the appropriate derivative and solving it for zero. That still might require solving a nonlinear problem though. We will directly setup and solve the constrained optimization.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
from scipy.optimize import fmin_slsqp
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def objective(X):
    i, V = X
    return - i * V

def eqc(X):
    'equality constraint'
    i, V = X
    return (0.5 - 0.5 * V**2) - i

X0 = [0.2, 0.6]
X = fmin_slsqp(objective, X0, eqcons=[eqc])

imax, Vmax = X


V = np.linspace(0, 1)

def i(V):
    return 0.5 - 0.5 * V**2

plt.plot(V, i(V), Vmax, imax, 'ro')
plt.savefig('images/P2.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Optimization terminated successfully.    (Exit mode 0)

You can see the maximum power is approximately 0.2 (unspecified units), at the conditions indicated by the red dot in the figure above.
