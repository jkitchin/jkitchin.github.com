I keep forgetting about this interesting gem of a feature in org-mode code blocks. You can put references to specific lines of code outside the block!
http://orgmode.org/manual/Literal-examples.html#Literal-examples

The following code block has some references in it that we can refer to later:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                   (ref:sc)
  (goto-char (point-min)))        (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                   (ref:sc)
  (goto-char (point-min)))        (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC


In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position. [[(jump)][Line (jump)]] jumps to point-min.

To make this work with python we have to make a slight change to the reference format in the header.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r -l "#(ref:%s)"
for i in range(5):                #(ref:for)
    print i                       #(ref:body)
#+END_SRC
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC python -n -r -l "#(ref:%s)"
for i in range(5):                #(ref:for)
    print i                       #(ref:body)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 0
: 1
: 2
: 3
: 4


In line [[(for)]] we initialize the loop, and in line [[(body)]] we run it.
