I have setup a reftex citation format that inserts a cite link using reftex like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(eval-after-load 'reftex-vars
  '(progn
      (add-to-list 'reftex-cite-format-builtin
                   '(org "Org-mode citation"
                         ((?\C-m . "cite:%l"))))))
#+END_SRC

I mostly like this, but it does not let me add citations to an existing citation; doing that leads to the insertion of an additional cite within the citation, which is an error. One way to make this simple is to add another cite format which simple returns the selected keys. You would use this with the cursor at the end of the link, and it will just append the results.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'reftex-cite-format-builtin
                   '(org "Org-mode citation"
                         ((?\C-m . "cite:%l")
			  (?a . ",%l"))))
#+END_SRC

That actually works nicely. I would like a better approach though, that involves less keywork. Ideally, a single function that does what I want, which is when on a link, append to it, and otherwise insert a new citation link. Today I will develop a function that fixes that problem. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun insert-cite-link ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((object (org-element-context))
	 (link-string-beginning (org-element-property :begin object))
	 (link-string-end (org-element-property :end object))
	 (path (org-element-property :path object)))    
    (if (and (equal (org-element-type object) 'link) 
               (equal (org-element-property :type object) "cite"))
	(progn
	  (goto-char link-string-end)
	  (insert (concat "," (mapconcat 'identity (reftex-citation t ?a) ","))))
      (insert (concat "cite:" (mapconcat 'identity (reftex-citation t) ",")))
      )))
#+END_SRC

That function is it! Org-mode just got a lot better. That function only puts a cite link in, but since that is all I use 99.99+% of the time, it works fine for me!
