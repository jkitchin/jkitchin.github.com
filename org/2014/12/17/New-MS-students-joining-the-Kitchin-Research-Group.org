Four new MS students are joining the group!

Zhaofeng Chen will use density functional theory to model segregation in noble metal alloys.

Venkatesh Naik will investigate the apeciation of carbon dioxide in alkaline and amine‚Äêcontaining solutions using Raman spectroscopy.

Hari Thirumalai will examine the effects of dispersion on scaling relations of atomic adsorbates using density functional theory.

Siddharth Deshpande will be co-advised by [[http://www.cmu.edu/me/people/venkat-viswanathan.html][Prof. Viswanathan]] in Mechanical Engineering to use density functional theory to investigate non-precious metal sulfides for the oxygen reduction reaction.

Welcome to the group!
