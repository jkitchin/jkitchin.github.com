[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson%27s_polynomial][Wilkinson's polynomial]] is defined as
\(  w(x) = \prod_{i=1}^{20} (x - i) = (x-1)(x-2) \ldots (x-20) \). 

This innocent looking function has 20 roots, which are 1,2,3,...,19,20. Here is a plot of the function.

    p = np.prod(np.array([x - i for i in range(1, 21)]))

Let us consider the expanded version of the polynomial. We will use sympy to expand the polynomial.

The coefficients are orders of magnitude apart in size. This should make you nervous, because the roots of this equation are between 1-20, but there are numbers here that are O(19). This is likely to make any rounding errors in the number representations very significant, and may lead to issues with accuracy of the solution. Let us explore that.

We will get the roots using numpy.roots.

The roots are not exact. Even more to the point, the polynomial does not evaluate to zero at the calculated roots! Something is clearly wrong here. The polynomial function is fine, and it does evaluate to zero at the known roots which are integers. It is subtle, but up to that point, we are using only integers, which can be represented exactly. The roots function is evidently using some float math, and the floats are not the same as the integers.

If we simply change the roots to floats, and reevaluate our polynomial, we get dramatically different results.

This also happens if we make the polynomial coefficients floats. That happens because in Python whenever one element is a float the results of math operations with that element are floats.

Let us try to understand what is happening here. It turns out that the integer and float representations of the numbers are different! It is known that you cannot exactly represent numbers as floats.

print '{0:<30s}{1:<30s}{2}'.format('Integer','Float','\delta')

Now you can see the issue. Many of these numbers are identical in integer and float form, but five of them are not. The integer /cannot/ be exactly represented as a float, and there is a difference in the representations. It is a small difference compared to the magnitude, but these kinds of differences get raised to high powers, and become larger. You may wonder why I used "0:<30s>" to print the integer? That is because =pj= in that loop is an object from sympy, which prints as a string. 

This is a famous, and well known problem that is especially bad for this case. This illustrates that you cannot simply rely on what a computer tells you the answer is, without doing some critical thinking about the problem and the solution. Especially in problems where there are coefficients that vary by many orders of magnitude you should be cautious.

There are a few interesting webpages on this topic, which inspired me to work this out in python. These webpages go into more detail on this problem, and provide additional insight into the sensitivity of the solutions to the polynomial coefficients.
