* A dynamic snippet for a task due 7 days from now

I have been playing with yasnippets. A pretty cool feature is that you can run elisp code in the template to generate text. Below, I define a snippet that will create a todo item due 7 days from the time you define it. This is an unconventional way to define a snippet, but I did not want to save it to a file just to try it out. So, I put it in a temporary buffer, and load it from there. When you run this block, it will note it is a new snippet, and ask if you want to save it. You can say no. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(yas-global-mode)
(with-temp-buffer
  (insert "# name : todo-followup
# --

*************** TODO $1
${2:		 DEADLINE: `(let ((seven-days (seconds-to-time (* 7 24 60 60))))
  (format-time-string \"<%Y-%m-%d %a>\" (time-add (current-time) seven-days)))`}$0
*************** END

		:END:
")
  (yas-load-snippet-buffer-and-close 'org-mode))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:


Now, you will have a new entry in the YASnippet menu that is called todo-followup. If you put the cursor on a blank line, and select that entry you get this below (after you fill in the text for the headline, of course!):


*************** TODO see how many times this was viewed
		DEADLINE: <2014-02-23 Sun>
*************** END 


That is pretty nice, as it saves a lot of keystrokes for that particular kind of task.
