2016 was another good year for the Kitchin Research Group. Here are a few highlights.

** Student accomplishments

Elif Erdinc joined the group to work on her PhD in CO_{2} capture.

Sanjna Bhartiya and Jean Haddad joined the group as undergraduate researchers.

Zhongnan Xu and Alex Hallenbeck completed their PhDs and graduated. Zhongnan is doing postdoctoral work with Dane Morgan at the University of Wisconsin.

Chen Wang, Akshay Tharval, Teng Ma, Feiyang Geng, Devon Walker, and Tianyu Gao completed their MS degrees and have graduated.

Congratulations everyone!

** Publications

2016 was a moderate year for publications for us. We currently have five manuscripts under review. Here are the papers published in 2016.

Papers on org-mode and publishing:
- cite:kitchin-2015-data-surfac-scien :: A perspective on data sharing in surface science
- cite:kitchin-2016-autom-data :: concept to automate data embedding in publications

Machine learning and molecular simulation:
- cite:boes-2016-neural-networ :: Training neural networks with DFT for molecular simulations

Collaborations:
- cite:bligaard-2016-towar-bench :: A perspective on benchmarking in catalysis
- cite:deshpande-2016-quant-uncer :: Uncertainty in volcano relationships
- cite:calfa-2016-proper-predic :: A machine learning approach to materials design
- cite:kitchin-2016-high-throug :: A perspective on highthroughput methods in engineering

Accepted in 2016:
- cite:boes-2016-neural-networ-pdo :: Neural networks for coverage dependent adsorption properties
- cite:xu-2017-first-princ :: Predictions of epitaxial stabilization of oxide films



For the first year, it looks like we got fewer citations than the previous year. I am not sure what that means.

** Emacs and org-mode

We have continued to develop Emacs and org-mode into a fantastic scientific writing tool. scimax (https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax) replaced jmax as our emacs starterkit.

org-ref (https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref) has been downloaded more than 10,000 times now from MELPA! I helped rewrite the link code for org-mode version 9 to make it easier to do some things we invented in org-ref (custom colored links, link keymaps, etc...). org-mode 9 is out now, and our standard. org-ref continues to get better.

We released ox-clip (https://melpa.org/#/ox-clip) which lets you copy formatted org-mode into applications like MS Word.

This year I hope to focus on integrating org-mode files with a backend database to make searching more powerful and to make it easier to create novel agendas. Another goal is figuring how to get human-readable, semantically marked up data in scientific documents. Finally, I hope to make some progress in developing interactive tutorials to help people learn how to use scimax.

** vaspy

We rewrote the Python library for Vasp in ASE (https://github.com/jkitchin/vasp) and updated dft-book to use it. This new version is ase-compliant, and allows a more functional style of scripting with integration to the queue system.

** Social media
*** github

It was a busy year for me on https://github.com/jkitchin. We use github for everything from software development to scientific paper writing.

*** DONE kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu

Our research blog (this one) continues to grow bit by bit. We only had about 58 blog posts in 2016. For the first time it got slightly more pageviews than matlab.cheme.cmu.edu. That is pretty amazing since I have not added anything to matlab.cheme.cmu.edu since the summer of 2013!
