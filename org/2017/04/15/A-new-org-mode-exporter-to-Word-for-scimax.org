I am continuing to chip away to getting a reasonable export behavior for org-mode to MS Word. I have previously made some progress with Pandoc [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/01/29/Export-org-mode-to-docx-with-citations-via-pandoc/][here]] and [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2015/06/11/ox-pandoc-org-mode-+-org-ref-to-docx-with-bibliographies/][here]], but those solutions never stuck with me. So here is another go. Here I leverage Pandoc again, but use a path through LaTeX to get citations without modifying the org-ref cite link syntax. The code for this can be found here: https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/ox-word.el. The gist is you use org-ref like you always do, and you specify the bibliography style for Pandoc like this:

#+attr_org: :width 300

You can download other csl files at https://www.zotero.org/styles. Then you can simply export the org-doc to a Word document with the key-binding C-c C-e w p.

Here is an example document to illustrate the exporter. I have written about data sharing in catalysis cite:kitchin-2015-examp and surface science cite:kitchin-2015-data-surfac-scien.

Here is an example source block.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :results output drawer
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
#+END_SRC

:END:

See Ref. ref:fig:line for example. These do not work. That might require additional pre-processing to replace them with numbers.

Here is the Word document that is generated: file:2017-04-15.docx

As a penultimate result it might be ok. The references are reasonably formatted, but not compatible with Endnote, or other bibliography manager software. There are still some issues with Figure numbering and cross-references, but it is not too bad. The main benefit of this seems to be that one source generates HTML and the Word document.
