In our latest paper, we developed a high-throughput method to efficiently determine the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of binary surfactant mixtures using a 96-well plate setup. Instead of relying on traditional regression techniques, we used a physics-informed classification approach based on regular solution theory to identify the micellization boundary. By combining model-driven experimental design with a dye solubilization assay, we mapped out the CMC across mixture compositions and accurately extracted the binary interaction parameter, β. We validated the method using the SDS-C8E4 system, and extended it to an electrolyte-rich environment, showing less than 15–18% deviation from literature values. This approach not only accelerates formulation screening but also lays the groundwork for analyzing more complex surfactant systems in the future.
