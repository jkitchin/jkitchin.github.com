In our recent paper, Multiscale Perturbation Methods for Dynamic/Programmable Catalysis, Carolina Colombo Tedesco, Carl Laird, Aditya Khair, and I developed an analytical framework for modeling dynamic catalysis—where catalyst binding energies are periodically modulated to overcome Sabatier limitations and enhance reaction rates. Building on our previous boundary value problem approach for simulating cyclic steady states, we applied multiscale perturbation theory to decompose the system response into slow (average) and fast (oscillatory) components. This allowed us to derive closed-form expressions for surface coverages and limit cycles without costly numerical integration. The method accurately reproduces results from full simulations for linear systems when the forcing frequency is high and amplitudes are small to moderate, providing insight into how oscillating catalytic systems behave and when they deviate from quasi-static assumptions. Beyond dynamic catalysis, this analytical framework may be useful for understanding other periodically driven systems where time-scale separation enables simple yet powerful approximations.
