In this work we show that prediction errors from graph neural networks for related atomistic systems tend to be correlated, and as a result the differences in energy are more accurate than the absolute energies. This is similar to what is observed in DFT calculations where systematic errors also cancel in differences. We show this quantitatively through differences of systems with systematically different levels of similarity.
