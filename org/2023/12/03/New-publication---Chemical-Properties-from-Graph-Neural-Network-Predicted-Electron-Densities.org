The electron density is one of the most important quantities we use DFT to calculate. It is the foundation of how we compute energy, forces, and many other properties. DFT is expensive though, so in this work we show that we can build a graph neural network that can be used to predict electron densities directly from the atomic coordinates of a system. We show that the predicted densities can also be used to estimate dipole moments and Bader charges.
