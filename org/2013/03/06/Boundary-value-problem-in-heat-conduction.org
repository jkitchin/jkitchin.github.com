For steady state heat conduction the temperature distribution in one-dimension is governed by the Laplace equation:

$$ \nabla^2 T = 0$$

with boundary conditions that at $T(x=a) = T_A$ and $T(x=L) = T_B$.

The analytical solution is not difficult here: $T = T_A-\frac{T_A-T_B}{L}x$, but we will solve this by finite differences.

For this problem, lets consider a slab that is defined by x=0 to x=L, with $T(x=0) = 100$, and $T(x=L) = 200$. We want to find the function T(x) inside the slab.

We approximate the second derivative by finite differences as

\( f''(x) \approx \frac{f(x-h) - 2 f(x) + f(x+h)}{h^2} \)

Since the second derivative in this case is equal to zero, we have at each discretized node $0 = T_{i-1} - 2 T_i + T_{i+1}$. We know the values of $T_{x=0} = \alpha$ and $T_{x=L} = \beta$.

\[A = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc} %
 -2         & 1 & 0                    & 0 & 0 \\
1           & -2& 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0                    & \ddots               & \ddots               & \ddots & 0 \\
0                    & 0                    & 1 & -2 & 1 \\
0                    & 0                    & 0  & 1  & -2  \end{array} \right ] \]

\[ x = \left [ \begin{array}{c} T_1 \\ \vdots \\ T_N \end{array} \right ] \]

\[ b = \left [ \begin{array}{c} -T(x=0) \\
0 \\
\vdots \\
0 \\
-T(x=L) \end{array} \right] \]

These are linear equations in the unknowns $x$ that we can easily solve. Here, we evaluate the solution.
