There will be times it is convenient to either read data from Excel, or write data to Excel. This is possible in python (http://www.python-excel.org/). You may also look at (https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl/wiki/Home).

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import xlrd

wb = xlrd.open_workbook('data/example.xlsx')
sh1 = wb.sheet_by_name(u'Sheet1')

print sh1.col_values(0)  # column 0
print sh1.col_values(1)  # column 1

sh2 = wb.sheet_by_name(u'Sheet2')

x = sh2.col_values(0)  # column 0
y = sh2.col_values(1)  # column 1

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig('images/excel-1.png')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: [u'value', u'function']
: [2.0, 3.0]

*** Writing Excel workbooks
Writing data to Excel sheets is pretty easy. Note, however, that this overwrites the worksheet if it already exists.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import xlwt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0, 2)
y = np.sqrt(x)

# save the data
book = xlwt.Workbook()

sheet1 = book.add_sheet('Sheet 1')

for i in range(len(x)):
    sheet1.write(i, 0, x[i])
    sheet1.write(i, 1, y[i])

book.save('data/example2.xls') # maybe can only write .xls format
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Updating an existing Excel workbook
It turns out you have to make a copy of an existing workbook, modify the copy and then write out the results using the =xlwt= module.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from xlrd import open_workbook

from xlutils.copy import copy

rb = open_workbook('data/example2.xls',formatting_info=True)
rs = rb.sheet_by_index(0)

wb = copy(rb)

ws = wb.add_sheet('Sheet 2')
ws.write(0, 0, "Appended")

wb.save('data/example2.xls')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

*** Summary
Matlab has better support for interacting with Excel than python does right now. You could get better Excel interaction via COM, but that is Windows specific, and requires you to have Excel installed on your computer. 
If you only need to read or write data, then xlrd/xlwt or the openpyxl modules will server you well.
