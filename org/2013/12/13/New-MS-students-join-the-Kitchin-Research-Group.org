Three new M.S. students have joined the Kitchin Research Group! We are pleased to welcome Wenqin You, Meiheng Lu, and Nitish Govindarajan!

Wenqin will work on modeling CO2 capture processes, Meiheng will work on a data sharing project, and Nitish will use density functional theory to model oxide materials relevant to SOFCs and CO2 conversion.
