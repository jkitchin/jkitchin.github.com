Our manuscript titled "Comparisons of Amine Solvents for Post-combustion CO$_2$ Capture: A Multi-objective Analysis Approach" by Anita Lee, John Eslick, David Miller, and John Kitchin was just accepted in International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control. In this paper we used a genetic algorithm to find pareto-optimal operating conditions of amine solvent CO2 capture systems that minimize capital cost and parasitic power cost. We compared MEA, DEA and AMP, and found that there are operating conditions where both solvents could be better than MEA.
