Three new PhD students have joined the Kitchin Research Group! We are pleased to welcome Mehak Chawla, Qingqi (Victor) Fan, and John Michael (co-advised by Professor Paul Sides) to the group.

Mehak joins us from The Ohio State University. She will be using density functional theory to model metal alloy and oxide surface reactivity.

John completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at Miami University (OH). He will be using the imaging ammeter to screen electrocatalysts. He will be co-advised by Dr. Sides.

Victor joins us from the University of Tulsa. He will be studying oxygen evolution electrocatalysis on transition metal oxides.
