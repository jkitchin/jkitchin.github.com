We can combine operations to evaluate complex equations. Consider the value of the equation $x^3 - \log(x)$ for the value $x=4.1$.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
x = 3
print x**3 - np.log(x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113

It would be tedious to type this out each time. Next, we learn how to express this equation as a new function, which we can call with different values.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import numpy as np
def f(x):
    return x**3 - np.log(x)

print f(3)
print f(5.1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 25.9013877113
: 131.02175946

It may not seem like we did much there, but this is the foundation for solving equations in the future. Before we get to solving equations, we have a few more details to consider. Next, we consider evaluating functions on arrays of values.
