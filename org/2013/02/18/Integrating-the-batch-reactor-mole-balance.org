An alternative approach of evaluating an integral is to integrate a differential equation. For the batch reactor, the differential equation that describes conversion as a function of time is:

$\frac{dX}{dt} = -r_A V/N_{A0}$.

Given a value of initial concentration, or volume and initial number of moles of A, we can integrate this ODE to find the conversion at some later time. We assume that $X(t=0)=0$. We will integrate the ODE over a time span of 0 to 10,000 seconds.

You can read off of this figure to find the time required to achieve a particular conversion.
