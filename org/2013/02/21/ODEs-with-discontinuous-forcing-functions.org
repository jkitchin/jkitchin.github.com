A mixing tank initially contains 300 g of salt mixed into 1000 L of water. At t=0 min, a solution of 4 g/L salt enters the tank at 6 L/min. At t=10 min, the solution is changed to 2 g/L salt, still entering at 6 L/min. The tank is well stirred, and the tank solution leaves at a rate of 6 L/min. Plot the concentration of salt (g/L) in the tank as a function of time.

A mass balance on the salt in the tank leads to this differential equation: $\frac{dM_S}{dt} = \nu C_{S,in}(t) - \nu M_S/V$ with the initial condition that $M_S(t=0)=300$. The wrinkle is that the inlet conditions are not constant.

$$C_{S,in}(t) = \begin{array}{ll} 0 & t \le 0, \\ 4 & 0 < t \le 10, \\ 2 & t > 10. \end{array}$$

You can see the discontinuity in the salt concentration at 10 minutes due to the discontinous change in the entering salt concentration.
