Bessel's equation $x^2 y'' + x y' + (x^2 - \nu^2)y=0$ comes up often in engineering problems such as heat transfer. The solutions to this equation are the Bessel functions. To solve this equation numerically, we must convert it to a system of first order ODEs. This can be done by letting $z = y'$ and $z' = y''$ and performing the change of variables:

$$ y' = z$$

$$ z' = \frac{1}{x^2}(-x z - (x^2 - \nu^2) y$$

if we take the case where $\nu = 0$, the solution is known to be the Bessel function $J_0(x)$, which is represented in Matlab as besselj(0,x). The initial conditions for this problem are: $y(0) = 1$ and $y'(0)=0$.

There is a problem with our system of ODEs at x=0. Because of the $1/x^2$ term, the ODEs are not defined at x=0. If we start very close to zero instead, we avoid the problem.

You can see the numerical and analytical solutions overlap, indicating they are at least visually the same.
