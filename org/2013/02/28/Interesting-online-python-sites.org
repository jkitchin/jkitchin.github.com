  :END:
I have come across some very interesting online, /interactive/ python sites recently.

- http://interactivepython.org has some interactive books with embedded python interpreters in the exercises. 

- sympy actually has an [[http://live.sympy.org/][online shell]]! The [[http://docs.sympy.org/0.7.2/index.html][documentation]] has live examples in a shell you can use that is integrated with Sphinx. 

Here are a few others I came across:
- https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/ Ipython in your browser!
- http://www.trypython.org/#
- http://www.pythontutor.com/
- http://py-ide-online.appspot.com/
