We seek the solution to the following nonlinear equations:

$2 + x + y - x^2 + 8 x y + y^3 = 0$

$1 + 2x - 3y + x^2 + xy - y e^x = 0$

In principle this is easy, we simply need some initial guesses and a nonlinear solver. The challenge here is what would you guess? There could be many solutions. The equations are implicit, so it is not easy to graph them, but let us give it a shot, starting on the x range -5 to 5. The idea is set a value for x, and then solve for y in each equation.

    return 2 + x + y - x**2 + 8*x*y + y**3;

def g(x, y):
    return 1 + 2*x - 3*y + x**2 + x*y - y*np.exp(x)

x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 500)

You can see there is a solution near x = -1, y = 0, because both functions equal zero there. We can even use that guess with fsolve. It is disappointly easy! But, keep in mind that in 3 or more dimensions, you cannot perform this visualization, and another method could be required.

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
def func(X):
    x,y = X
    return [f(x, y), g(x, y)]

print fsolve(func, [-2, -2])

We explore a method that bypasses this problem today. The principle is to introduce a new variable, $\lambda$, which will vary from 0 to 1. at $\lambda=0$ we will have a simpler equation, preferrably a linear one, which can be easily solved, or which can be analytically solved. At $\lambda=1$, we have the original equations. Then, we create a system of differential equations that start at the easy solution, and integrate from $\lambda=0$ to $\lambda=1$, to recover the final solution.

We rewrite the equations as:

$f(x,y) = (2 + x + y) + \lambda(- x^2 + 8 x y + y^3) = 0$

$g(x,y) = (1 + 2x - 3y) + \lambda(x^2 + xy - y e^x) = 0$

Now, at $\lambda=0$ we have the simple linear equations:

$x + y = -2$

$2x - 3y = -1$

These equations are trivial to solve:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session
x0 = np.linalg.solve([[1., 1.], [2., -3.]],[ -2, -1])
print x0
#+END_SRC

We form the system of ODEs by differentiating the new equations with respect to $\lambda$. Why do we do that? The solution, (x,y) will be a function of $\lambda$. From calculus, you can show that:

$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial f}{\partial \lambda}$

$\frac{\partial g}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}+\frac{\partial g}{\partial y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}=-\frac{\partial g}{\partial \lambda}$

Now, solve this for $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$. You can use Cramer's rule to solve for these to yield:

\begin{eqnarray} \
\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial \lambda - \partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial y}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \\\\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda} &=& \frac{\partial f/\partial \lambda \partial g/\partial x - \partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial \lambda}{\partial f/\partial x \partial g/\partial y - \partial f/\partial y \partial g/\partial x } \end{eqnarray} 

For this set of equations: 

\begin{eqnarray} \
\partial f/\partial x &=& 1 - 2\lambda x + 8\lambda y \\\\ 
\partial f/\partial y &=& 1 + 8 \lambda x + 3 \lambda y^2 \\\\
\partial g/\partial x &=& 2 + 2 \lambda x + \lambda y - \lambda y e^x\\\\ 
\partial g/\partial y &=& -3 + \lambda x - \lambda e^x 
\end{eqnarray} 

Now, we simply set up those two differential equations on $\frac{\partial x}{\partial \lambda}$ and $\frac{\partial y}{\partial \lambda}$, with the initial conditions at $\lambda = 0$ which is the solution of the simpler linear equations, and integrate to $\lambda = 1$, which is the final solution of the original equations!

You can see the solution is somewhat approximate; the true solution is x = -1, y = 0. The approximation could be improved by lowering the tolerance on the ODE solver. The functions evaluate to a small number, close to zero. You have to apply some judgment to determine if that is sufficiently accurate. For instance if the units on that answer are kilometers, but you need an answer accurate to a millimeter, this may not be accurate enough.

This is a fair amount of work to get a solution! The idea is to solve a simple problem, and then gradually turn on the hard part by the lambda parameter. What happens if there are multiple solutions? The answer you finally get will depend on your $\lambda=0$  starting point, so it is possible to miss solutions this way. For problems with lots of variables, this would be a good approach if you can identify the easy problem.
