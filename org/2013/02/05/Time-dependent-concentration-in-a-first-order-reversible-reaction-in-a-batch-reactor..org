Given this reaction $A \rightleftharpoons B$, with these rate laws:

forward rate law: $-r_a = k_1 C_A$

backward rate law: $-r_b = k_{-1} C_B$

plot the concentration of A vs. time. This example illustrates a set of coupled first order ODES.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import numpy as np

def myode(C, t):
    # ra = -k1*Ca
    # rb = -k_1*Cb
    # net rate for production of A:  ra - rb
    # net rate for production of B: -ra + rb

    k1 = 1   # 1/min;
    k_1 = 0.5   # 1/min;

    Ca = C[0]
    Cb = C[1]

    ra = -k1 * Ca
    rb = -k_1 * Cb

    dCadt =  ra - rb
    dCbdt = -ra + rb

    dCdt = [dCadt, dCbdt]
    return dCdt

tspan = np.linspace(0, 5)

init = [1, 0]  # mol/L
C = odeint(myode, init, tspan)

Ca = C[:,0]
Cb = C[:,1]

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(tspan, Ca, tspan, Cb)
plt.xlabel('Time (min)')
plt.ylabel('C (mol/L)')
plt.legend(['$C_A$', '$C_B$'])
plt.savefig('images/reversible-batch.png')

That is it. The main difference between this and Matlab is the order of arguments in odeint is different, and the ode function has differently ordered arguments.
