We want to solve a linear boundary value problem of the form: y'' = p(x)y' + q(x)y + r(x) with boundary conditions y(x1) = alpha and y(x2) = beta.

For this example, we solve the plane poiseuille flow problem using a finite difference approach. An advantage of the approach we use here is we do not have to rewrite the second order ODE as a set of coupled first order ODEs, nor do we have to provide guesses for the solution. We do, however, have to discretize the derivatives and formulate a linear algebra problem.

we want to solve u'' = 1/mu*DPDX with u(0)=0 and u(0.1)=0. for this problem we let the plate separation be d=0.1, the viscosity $\mu = 1$, and $\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta x} = -100$.

The idea behind the finite difference method is to approximate the derivatives by finite differences on a grid. See here for details. By discretizing the ODE, we arrive at a set of linear algebra equations of the form $A y = b$, where $A$ and $b$ are defined as follows.

\[A = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc} %
 2 + h^2 q_1         & -1 + \frac{h}{2} p_1 & 0                    & 0 & 0 \\
-1 - \frac{h}{2} p_2 & 2 + h^2 q_2          & -1 + \frac{h}{2} p_2 & 0 & 0 \\
0                    & \ddots               & \ddots               & \ddots & 0 \\
0                    & 0                    & -1 - \frac{h}{2} p_{N-1} & 2 + h^2 q_{N-1} & -1 + \frac{h}{2} p_{N-1} \\
0                    & 0                    & 0  & -1 - \frac{h}{2} p_N & 2 + h^2 q_N \end{array} \right ] \]

\[ y = \left [ \begin{array}{c} y_i \\ \vdots \\ y_N \end{array} \right ] \]

\[ b = \left [ \begin{array}{c} -h^2 r_1 + ( 1 + \frac{h}{2} p_1) \alpha \\
-h^2 r_2 \\
\vdots \\
-h^2 r_{N-1} \\
-h^2 r_N + (1 - \frac{h}{2} p_N) \beta \end{array} \right] \]

You can see excellent agreement here between the numerical and analytical solution.
