Recursive functions are functions that call themselves repeatedly until some exit condition is met. Today we look at a classic example of recursive function for computing a factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is denoted n!, and is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

The key ideas in defining a recursive function is that there needs to be some logic to identify when to terminate the function. Then, you need logic that calls the function again, but with a smaller part of the problem. Here we recursively call the function with n-1 until it gets called with n=0. 0! is defined to be 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

def recursive_factorial(n):
    '''compute the factorial recursively. Note if you put a negative
    number in, this function will never end. We also do not check if
    n is an integer.'''
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)

print recursive_factorial(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from scipy.misc import factorial
print factorial(5)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120.0

**** Compare to a loop solution

This example can also be solved by a loop. This loop is easier to read and understand than the recursive function. Note the recursive nature of defining the variable as itself times a number.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
n = 5
factorial_loop = 1
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial_loop *= i

print factorial_loop
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 120

There are some significant differences in this example than in Matlab. 

  1. the syntax of the for loop is quite different with the use of the =in= operator.
  2. python has the nice *= operator to replace a = a * i
  3. We have to loop from 1 to n+1 because the last number in the range is not returned.

*** Conclusions

Recursive functions have a special niche in mathematical programming. There is often another way to accomplish the same goal. That is not always true though, and in a future post we will examine cases where recursion is the only way to solve a problem.
