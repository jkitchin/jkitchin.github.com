I have gotten in the habit of building the latex file from commands, and manually running 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let ((org-latex-default-packages-alist
       '(("" "minted" nil)
         ("linktocpage,
  pdfstartview=FitH,
  colorlinks,
  linkcolor=blue,
  anchorcolor=blue,
  citecolor=blue,
  filecolor=blue,
  menucolor=blue,
  urlcolor=blue" "hyperref" t)))
      (async nil)
      (subtreep nil)
      (visible-only nil)
      (body-only nil))

  (org-latex-export-to-latex async subtreep visible-only body-only
			     '(:with-author nil
			       :with-date nil
			       :with-title nil
			       :with-toc nil)))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(progn
  (shell-command "pdflatex -shell-escape writing-exams-in-orgmode")
  (shell-command "pdflatex -shell-escape writing-exams-in-orgmode"))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

You can open the [[./writing-exams-in-orgmode.pdf][pdf]] and see the results. This works ok. There is still some work to be done. For example the boxes in the grade table are not very large. The references are a little odd, but that is an artifact of the fact that you cannot nest a section deeper than 3 levels in LaTeX without some work, and I nested my exam section in a second level heading so it would appear in the blog post. A real application of this would not have all these other sections, and would not export the build section. It is a tad tedious to hand build the table, but not too bad.
