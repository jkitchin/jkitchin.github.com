The James C. Meade Fellowship was made possible by a generous donation by James Meade. This will help support Zhitao during his research this year. Zhitao is a first year PhD student who is co-advised by Andy Gellman and myself (John Kitchin), and is working on segregation in ternary alloy thin films.

Zhitao joined us from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, where he studied chemical engineering and double majored in economics.

Congratulations Zhitao!
