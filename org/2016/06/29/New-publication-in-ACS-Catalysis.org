DFT calculations are not exact, and the uncertainties in a calculation can impact conclusions you draw from the results. In this work, we quantify the uncertainty in the adsorption energies on Pt(111) and (100) of oxygenated intermediates  relevant to the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism. We then propagate these uncertainties to the volcano plot of activity that results from them, and show how this approach helps inform us about the reliability of the predicted trends.
