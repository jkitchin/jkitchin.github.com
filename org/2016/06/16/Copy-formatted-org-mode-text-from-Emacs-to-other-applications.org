I do a lot of writing in org-mode and I thought it would be great if I could copy text from an org-file and paste it /with formatting/ into other applications, e.g. Word, Gmail, etc....  Curiosity got the better of me and I wondered how this is done in other applications. It works by creating a [[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/rtf-pocket-guide/9781449302047/ch01.html][Rich Text Format]] version of what you want to copy and then putting that on the clipboard. It isn't quite enough to just copy it, it needs to go in the clipboard as an RTF datatype. On Mac OSX I used [[http://osxdaily.com/2007/03/05/manipulating-the-clipboard-from-the-command-line/][pbcopy]] to make that happen.

One simple strategy to do this from org-mode is to generate HTML by export, and then convert it to RTF with a utility, e.g. textutil. For example like this. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun formatted-copy ()
  "Export region to HTML, and copy it to the clipboard."
  (interactive)
  (save-window-excursion
    (let* ((buf (org-export-to-buffer 'html "*Formatted Copy*" nil nil t t))
	   (html (with-current-buffer buf (buffer-string))))
      (with-current-buffer buf
	(shell-command-on-region
	 (point-min)
	 (point-max)
	 "textutil -stdin -format html -convert rtf -stdout | pbcopy")) 
      (kill-buffer buf))))

(global-set-key (kbd "H-w") 'formatted-copy)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: formatted-copy

This works well for everything but equations and images. Citations leave a bit to be desired, but improving this is still a challenge. 

Let us try this on some text. Some *bold*, /italic/, _underline_, +struck+ and =verbatim= text to copy. Here are some example Formulas: H_{2}O ionizes to form H^{+}. We simply must have an equation: \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\) [fn:1]. We should also have a citation cite:kitchin-2015-examp and multiple citations cite:kitchin-2016-autom-data,kitchin-2015-data-surfac-scien [fn:2].

A code block:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output org drawer :exports both
import pycse.orgmode as org
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 60, 500)
plt.figure(figsize=(4, 2))
plt.plot(np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.cos(x),
         np.exp(-0.1 * x) * np.sin(x))
org.figure(plt.savefig('spiral.png'),
           caption='A spiral.',
           attributes=[['org', ':width 100']])
print('')
org.table([['H1', 'H2'], None, [1, 2], [2, 4]],
          caption='A simple table')
print('')
org.result(6 * 7)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

In summary, this simple approach to generating RTF from exported HTML works really well for the simplest markups. To improve on getting figures in, getting cross-references, captions, proper references, etc... will require a more sophisticated export approach, and probably one that exports RTF directly. That is a big challenge for another day!
