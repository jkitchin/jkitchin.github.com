This paper uses a kernel regression method trained on a large set of DFT calculations from the Materials Project to design new materials. A notable feature of this approach is it opens the door to inverse design, since the mathematical form of the regression is accessible. In the paper we predict electronic properties and elastic constants for a large number of metal oxides. Congratulations Bruno for this work!
