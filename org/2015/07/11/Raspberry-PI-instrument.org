I want to setup a Flask app on the PI that can control some aspects of it.

E.g.

- A get request to retrieve some status
- a get request to change the status of the LEDs
- a post request to take a picture

If I can get this to work before NIST, show integration with Emacs+org-mode in lisp, python, curl.


#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

#if __name__ == "__main__":
app.run(host='127.0.0.1', port=8080, debug=True)
#+END_SRC
