It was a good year for the Kitchin Research Group. Here are a few of our main accomplishments for the year.

** Student accomplishments
Students are the backbone of our group. Steve Illes, Wenqin You, Meiheng Lu, and Nitish Govindarajan finished their MS degrees! Congratulations!

Mehak Chawla and John Michael both passed their PhD qualifying exams. Congratulations!

Prateek Mehta joined Bill Schneider's group at Notre Dame for his PhD!

Four new M.S. students have joined our group: Hari Thirumalai, Venkatesh Naik, Zhaofeng Chen, and Siddharth Deshpande. Welcome!

** Publications
It looks like seven publications this year. We have 5 out for review right now, so next year looks like a good one! Almost all of these were written in org-mode, with amazing, reproducible supporting information documents. Many thanks to my students, and co-authors.

** Teaching
This year I taught a core course in reaction engineering /from Emacs/ with Python and Emacs! I now teach two classes from Emacs: a graduate elective in molecular simulation (which I am teaching again this year), and a core MS course in reaction engineering.

** Recognitions
Professor Kitchin was awarded the Philip L. Dowd Fellowship Award in recognition of his work in integrating org-mode into education [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/02/28/Professor-Kitchin-awarded-the-Philip-L-Dowd-Fellowship-Award/][(link)]].

Mehak Chawla was awarded a Prengle Fellowship ([[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/03/24/Mehak-Chawla-selected-as-the-H-William-and-Ruth-Hamilton-Prengle-Fellow-of-Chemical-Enginering-for-2013-2014/][link]]).

Jacob Boes was awarded a Bertucci fellowship!

** Software development
   The most significant developments from our group this year were [[http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax][jmax]], an emacs starter-kit I developed, and [[http://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]], a bibliography/citation tool for scientific publications in org-mode. It is amazing. These can be found at http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax and http://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref.

Python Computations in science and engineering reached a higher level of maturity: http://github.com/jkitchin/pycse. We used this in my reaction engineering course quite a bit.

Zhongnan put his ase interface to Quantum Espresso here: https://github.com/zhongnanxu/espresso

** Social media
It looks like we had about 117 blog entries in 2014. The Kitchin Group blog has been growing in popularity:

** What's next in 2015?
We will continue developing jmax into the finest scientific publishing tool there ever was.

We will write a lot of papers with jmax. I predict we write more than ten papers next year. That will be a group record.

More good things to come! Stay tuned!
