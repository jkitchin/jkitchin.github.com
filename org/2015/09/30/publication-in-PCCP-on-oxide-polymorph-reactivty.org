We have a new publication in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. on the reactivity of different oxide polymorphs. In this work we examine the reactivity of some common BO_{2} oxide polymorphs for Ru, Rh, Pt and Ir oxides. These are all normally rutile formers, but it may be possible to synthesize them in other polymorphs as epitaxial films, or under pressure. We examined how the reactivity of the polymorphs would differ from that of the most stable phase, and the impact of those changes on the oxygen evolution reaction. We predict that the reactivity may be improved in some cases. Congratulations Zhongnan!

                  vital for advancing key technologies in catalysis and energy
                  conversion. One strategy is the modification of a material{'}s
                  crystal structure{,} and new methods allow for the synthesis
                  and stabilization of potential materials in a range of crystal
                  polymorph structures. We assess the potential reactivity of
                  four metastable oxide polymorphs of MO2 (M=Ru{,} Rh{,} Pt{,}
                  Ir) transition metal oxides. In spite of the similar local
                  geometry and coordination between atoms in the metastable
                  polymorphic and stable rutile structure{,} we find that
                  polymorph reactivities cannot be explained by strain alone and
                  offer tunable reactivity and increased stability.
                  Atom-projected density of states reveals that the unique
                  reactivity of polymorphs are caused by a redistribution of
                  energy levels of the t2g-states. This structure-activity
                  relationship is induced by slight distortions to the M-O bonds
                  in polymorphic structures and is unattainable by strain. We
                  predict columbite IrO2 to be more active than rutile IrO2 for
                  oxygen evolution",
