org-ref is out on [[https://melpa.org/#/org-ref][Melpa]]!

Checkout this video (\approx 10 min.) of what it can do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t925KRBbFc

Here are the files that we used/generated:

1. Emacs configuration: [[file:org-ref-melpa.el]]
2. Here is the "manuscript" file:manuscript.org  (note, I extracted the bibtex entries into this file)
3. The resulting PDF: file:manuscript.pdf

Some killer new features:
1. Drag-n-drop a PDF or url onto a bibtex file to add bibtex entries. This works when org-ref knows how to get a DOI from the PDF or url.
2. Tooltips on cite links

Thanks everyone who has already tried it out and reported bugs!
