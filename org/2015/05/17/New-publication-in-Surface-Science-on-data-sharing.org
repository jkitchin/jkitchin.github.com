In this perspective we illustrate how we use org-mode to prepare manuscripts and supporting information files that are rich in data, and that make it easy to share the code we use for our analysis. We use the supporting information file from cite:boes-2015-core-cu to show examples of how to extract the data, and reuse it in new analyses. This approach works for both computational and experimental data. You can see the manuscript I submitted here: [[./ss-manuscript-2015-05-07.zip]], and the org file that generated it here: [[./ss-manuscript.org]]. The references from the manuscript are contained here [[./ss-manuscript.bib]]
