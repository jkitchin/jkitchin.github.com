In this perspective we show an example of data sharing practices we have developed. We use the supporting information file from cite:boes-2015-estim-bulk to show how one can extract the data from our paper and reuse it for new purposes. We illustrate this for both computational and experimental data. We use org-mode for doing this, but we also show that data in the supporting information can be extracted using Python, and independently of Emacs, so that org-mode is not critical for people who do not use it.

The published version of this manuscript doesn't look exactly like the version I generated, for example, the output from the source blocks is missing. Hopefully that will make it into a supporting information file. Until then, you may be interested in the org file and version I submitted below.
