In this paper we show that the electrolyte can  modify the reactivity of nickel hydroxide based electrodes for electrochemical water oxidation. There are two effects that are important: 1) Fe-impurities, and 2) the identify of the electrolyte cation. Fe-impurities are known to promote water oxidation. We found that a LiOH electrolyte can /suppress/ the oxygen evolution reaction, which is also known from the battery literature. KOH and CsOH are the best electrolytes for the OER on nickel hydroxide based electrodes.
