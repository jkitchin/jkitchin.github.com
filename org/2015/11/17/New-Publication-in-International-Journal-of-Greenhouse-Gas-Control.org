We have published a new paper on CO_{2} capture in aqueous amino acid solvents! In this collaborative effort with the [[http://annalab.org][Anna Research group]] and NETL, we show that potassium lysinate solvents show potential for CO_{2} capture applications using a microfluidic characterization device and a continuously stirred tank reactor. We also examined the aqueous potassium salts of glycine, taurine and proline. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the speciation of CO_{2} in the solvent. Congratulations Alex!
