Modeling magnetic materials with DFT is hard. In this work we develop a machine learning approach to predicting magnetic properties of materials based on their structure. Our two stage model first predicts if a material is magnetic, and then if it is, what the magnetic moments on each atom are. We show this can lead to faster and lower energy DFT solutions.
