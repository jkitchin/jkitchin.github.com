You can get higher rates of reaction on a catalyst by dynamically changing the adsorbate and reaction energetics. It has been an open challenge though to find ways to obtain the optimal waveform. In this work we present a problem formulation that is easy to solve and optimize waveforms in programmable catalysis.
