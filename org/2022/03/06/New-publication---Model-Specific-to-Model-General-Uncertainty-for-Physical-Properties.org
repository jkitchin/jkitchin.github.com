When we fit models to data there are two kinds of uncertainty: the kind that represents uncertainty in the data, e.g. random noise that we cannot fit, and uncertainty in the model, e.g. are we using the right one. With a physics based model, we get model-specific estimates of uncertainty. We show in this paper how to think about and quantify these kinds of errors, and particularly how to use Bayesian models like a Gaussian process to get a model-general error when making predictions about physical properties.
