In this paper we combine  density functional theory, machine learning, Monte Carlo simulations and experimental data to study segregation in a ternary alloy Cu-Pd-Au surface across the composition space. We found varying agreement and disagreement between tehe simulated and experimental results, and discuss the origins of these. Overall, Au segregates significantly across the composition space, and we learned a lot about the contributions to the discrepancies observed in Cu-Pd segregation and Au-Cu segregration.
