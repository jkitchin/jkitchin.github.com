The most significant developments from our group this year were <a href="http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax">jmax</a> , an emacs starter-kit I developed, and <a href="http://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a> , a bibliography/citation tool for scientific publications in org-mode. It is amazing. These can be found at <a href="http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax">http://github.com/jkitchin/jmax</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">http://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref</a> .

Python Computations in science and engineering reached a higher level of maturity: <a href="http://github.com/jkitchin/pycse">http://github.com/jkitchin/pycse</a> . We used this in my reaction engineering course quite a bit.

<p>
We will continue developing jmax into the finest scientific publishing tool there ever was.
</p>

<p>
We will write a lot of papers with jmax. I predict we write more than ten papers next year. That will be a group record.
</p>

<p>
More good things to come! Stay tuned!
