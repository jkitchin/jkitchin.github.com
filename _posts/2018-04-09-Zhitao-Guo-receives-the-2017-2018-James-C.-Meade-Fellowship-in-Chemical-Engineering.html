<p>
The James C. Meade Fellowship was made possible by a generous donation by James Meade. This will help support Zhitao during his research this year. Zhitao is a first year PhD student who is co-advised by Andy Gellman and myself (John Kitchin), and is working on segregation in ternary alloy thin films.
