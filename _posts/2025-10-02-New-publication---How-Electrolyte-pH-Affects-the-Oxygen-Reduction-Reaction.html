<p>
In our recent work published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, we investigated how electrolyte pH affects the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) - a critical process in fuel cells and batteries. Working with an outstanding team including Jay Bender, Rohan Sanspeur, and colleagues from UT Austin, we tackled a long-standing puzzle: why does changing pH dramatically affect ORR rates on some catalysts (like Au) but barely affect others (like Pt)?
</p>

<p>
Through careful electrochemical experiments, we measured ORR activity across different metals in both acidic and alkaline conditions. The results were striking - Au catalysts showed dramatically increased activity when moving from acid to base, while Pt remained essentially unchanged. Our kinetic analysis revealed that the rate-determining steps don't actually change with pH, challenging previous explanations.
</p>

<p>
The breakthrough came from combining these experiments with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discovered that electric field effects provide a unifying explanation. When pH increases, the interfacial electric field becomes more negative. This field change strongly stabilizes the key reaction intermediate (*Oâ‚‚) on weakly binding metals like Au, dramatically lowering activation barriers. On strongly binding metals like Pt, the reaction intermediates are much less sensitive to electric fields, explaining their pH-independent behavior.
</p>

<p>
This computational insight allowed us to extend our understanding to other metals (Ag, Ir, Ru, Pd), confirming the general principle: pH effects depend on how field-sensitive the rate-determining intermediates are.
</p>

<p>
Our work demonstrates the power of combining rigorous experimental kinetics with advanced computational modeling. By understanding these fundamental electric field effects, we can now predict and potentially engineer pH-dependent catalytic behavior - opening new avenues for optimizing electrochemical energy conversion devices.
