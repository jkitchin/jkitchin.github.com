Water splitting is a crucial technology for renewable hydrogen generation. Under acid conditions most metals that would be used for the oxidation reaction tend to dissolve, limiting their utility. Iridium oxide is widely regarded as the most active and stable material, but it is very expensive. Ruthenium oxide is the next most active material, but it is less stable and tends to dissolve over time. In this work we studied 36,000 mixed metal oxides to identify potential compositions that would stabilize ruthenium from dissolution. We found a candidate Ru<sub>0.6</sub>Cr<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with promise. We synthesized this material anf show that it has superior stability and improved activity compared to RuO<sub>2</sub>.
