<p>
I have been thinking about ways to search my bibtex file with multiple criteria. Eventually, I want a decent natural language search like "au=kitchin and alloy" to find papers authored by me about alloys. For now, I am going to settle with a way to find these. This strategy will create a search function that prints the entries that are found. Here is the prototype idea:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #8b0000;">defun</span> <span style="color: #8b2323;">my-search</span> (key start end)
  (<span style="color: #8b0000;">when</span> (and (re-search-forward <span style="color: #228b22;">"kitchin"</span> end t)
           (re-search-forward <span style="color: #228b22;">"alloy"</span> end t))
      (princ (format <span style="color: #228b22;">"%s\n"</span> (buffer-substring start end)))))

(<span style="color: #8b0000;">with-temp-buffer</span>
  (insert-file-contents <span style="color: #228b22;">"../../bibliography/references.bib"</span>)
  (bibtex-map-entries  'my-search))

  abstract =	 {The identification of sulfur-tolerant alloys for
                  catalytic applications is difficult due to the
                  combinatorially large number of alloy compositions
                  and surface structures that may be
                  considered. Density functional theory calculations
                  (DFT) are not fast enough to enumerate all the
                  possible structures and their sulfur tolerance. In
                  this work, a DFT parametrized algebraic model that
                  accounts for structure and composition was used to
                  estimate the d-band properties and sulfur adsorption
                  energies of 370 transition metal-based bimetallic
                  alloy surfaces.  The estimated properties were
                  validated by DFT calculations for 110 of the surface
                  structures. We then utilized an atomistic
                  thermodynamic framework that includes surface
                  segregation, the presence of adsorbates, and effects
                  of environmental conditions to identify alloy
                  compositions and structures with enhanced sulfur
                  tolerance that are likely to be stable under the
                  environmental conditions. As a case study, we show
                  how this database can be used to identify
                  sulfur-tolerant Cu-based catalysts and compare the
                  results with what is known about these catalysts
                  experimentally.},

<p>
That is not too bad. If I had a parser like <a href="http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/03/31/Using-pyparsing-for-search-queries-with-tags/">this one</a> , I could do some reasonable searches. I could try integrating it with reftex or something similar for selecting citations. I would like that a lot.
</p>

<p>
What if I wanted to find articles with Kitchin as an author, and alloy in the title? This is my best effort at doing that, where I explicitly match the fields in the bibtex entries.

<p>
This is a more precise search, which yields only one entry. That is not exactly nimble searching, but it does provide precision. I need to think about this some more.
