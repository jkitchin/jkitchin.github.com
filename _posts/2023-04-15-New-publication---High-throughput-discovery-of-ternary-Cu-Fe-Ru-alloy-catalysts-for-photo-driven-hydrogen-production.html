Finding new ways to make hydrogen with renewable energy and renewable feedstocks using earth abundant materials remains a challenge in catalysis today. Metal nanoparticles are common heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogen production, and their properties can often be improved by using multiple metals at a time. In this work we show a high-throughput experimental approach to discovering a ternary alloy catalyst containing earth abundant metals that is more active at producing hydrogen than any of the pure metals it is made of. It a surprising discovery because these metals are not typically miscible, and they do not form a well characterized material, but rather a distribution of particle sizes and compositions.
